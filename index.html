<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Crystal Fire: The Birth of the Information Age (Sloan Technology Series)</h2><p>Focuses on the human factors behind the invention of the twentieth century&#39;s defining artifact, the transistor, highlighting the pride, jealousy, and scientific ambitions of the Bell Labs team who spawned the epoch-making technology.</p><p>The microchip at the heart of your computer is a complex device, but its historical origins go back to one crude-looking little gadget made up of a wedge of plastic, a strip of gold foil, a rough-hewn slab of crystallized germanium, some wires, and a bent-up paper clip. Slapped together by two Bell Labs experimenters on December 16, 1947, this invention later came to be known as the transistor, and it is the ancestor of every microchip in operation today.<p> <i>Crystal Fire</i> tells the story of the creation and development of that gadget, demonstrating that very little about the transistor's invention was as simple it seemed. The device put together on that December day was no idle experiment, but the product of decades of high-level research--and the first major practical application of the esoteric quantum mechanics that had emerged from European particle physics at the beginning of the century.</p><p> Just as fascinating as the scientific background, though, is the story of the brains and events behind the invention of the transistor. The collaboration and rivalry of the three men credited with the invention--the brilliant John Bardeen, the likable Walter Brattain, and the appallingly driven William Shockley--hold center stage. However, authors Riordan and Hoddeson make it clear that the unique organizational resources of Bell Labs, the furious course of the war effort, and the random twists and turns of historical accident played equally important roles. The saga makes for a gripping read and a crash course in the dizzying complexity of information-age invention. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p>Michael Riordan has written several popular books on science and technology. He lives in Santa Cruz, California. Lillian Hoddeson teaches at the University of Illinois and lives in Urbana.</p><h2>Year of the King: An Actor&#39;s Diary and Sketchbook</h2><p>(Limelight). &#34;This is the most wonderfully authentic account of the experience of creating a performance. It&#39;s full of delicate and sometimes moving observation; full of striking information...; full of the frustration and tedium and occasional tears of the unequal struggle of any of us flawed thespians with ourselves and a great role; and full of his own astonishing and unforgettable drawings. Images, images. What images!&#34; Simon Callow, The Sunday Times (London)</p><p>Actor Antony Sher has had an impressive career on the London stage and in a variety of highly visible character roles in film (including a lauded portrayal as Disraeli in 1997's <i>Mrs. Brown</i>). In this highly entertaining journal, he chronicles the months of preparation for one of the most critically acclaimed Shakespearean performances in the 20th century, his 1984 portrayal of Richard III, which he played on a pair of custom-made crutches that transformed the Bard's villainous king into a poisonous, scuttling spider. His preparations include attempts to get into the mental territory of a sociopath and discussions with doctors, patients, and physical therapists about the physical realities of playing a hunchback. Along the way we get insights into his South African heritage, discussions of the life of a working actor, and an often funny and always illuminating portrait of a year working in the Royal Shakespeare Company--all illustrated with numerous sketches and cartoons from this multitalented author. <i>Year of the King</i> is a grand tour of the inner workings of one of the world's greatest theaters, by an actor at the height of his creative powers. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p><h2>Swift Vengeance (A Roland Ford Novel)</h2><p><b>In this incendiary thriller from three-time Edgar Award winner and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author T. Jefferson Parker, Roland Ford is hunting down a mysterious killer, jockeying for position with the FBI, and risking everything to save a friend in terrible jeopardy.</b><br><br>Returning hero and private investigator Roland Ford is on the trail of a mysterious killer who is beheading CIA drone operators and leaving puzzling clues at each crime scene. His troubled friend Lindsay Rakes is afraid for her own life and the life of her son after a fellow flight crew member is killed in brutal fashion. Even more terrifying is the odd note the killer left behind: "Welcome to Caliphornia. This is not the last." Ford strikes an uneasy alliance with San Diego-based FBI agent Joan Taucher, who is tough as nails but haunted by what she sees as the Bureau's failure to catch the 9/11 terrorists, many of whom spent their last days in her city. As the killer strikes again, Ford and Taucher dash into the fray, each desperate for their own reasons--each ready to risk it all to stop the killer from doing far more damage.</p><p><b>T. Jefferson Parker</b> is the author of numerous novels and short stories, the winner of three Edgar Awards, and the recipient of a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize for best mystery. Before becoming a full-time novelist, he was an award-winning reporter. He lives in Fallbrook, California, and can be found at tjeffersonparker.com.The first time I saw Lindsey Rakes she was burning down the high-stakes room in the Pala Casino north of San Diego. Roulette, and she could do no wrong. Big woman, big attitude. Daughter of a Fort Worth-area Ford dealer-"Hit Your Brakes for Rakes!"-and a high school chemistry teacher, I found out later.<br><br>Lindsey had drawn a crowd that night. Not difficult, in her lacy dress and leather ankle boots. And all that sleek, dark hair. She looked like some exotic life form, dropped from above into the chain-smoking slot-jockeys and the glum blackjack casualties. When the wheel stopped on another winner, her throaty roar blasted through the room: Baby, baby, BABY! Towers of chips rising from the table in front of her. Mostly hundreds and fifties. Just enough twenties to tip the cocktail waitresses, who kept the drinks coming. I had work to do, so I didn't witness her crash.<br><br>Now, almost two and a half years later, Lindsey sat at a long wooden picnic table under a palapa behind my house. She looked not very much like that booze-fueled gambler who had moved onto my property the day after we'd met in the casino. Now she looked defeated and afraid. She wore a faded denim blouse and her hair was lumped into a ponytail that rode side-saddle on her shoulder.<br><br>I held the sheet of paper flush against the tabletop, a fingertip at diagonal corners, and read it out loud for a second time.<br><br>Dear Lt. Rakes,<br><br>I want to decapitate you with my knife, but I will use anything necessary to cause you death.<br><br>Until then, fear everything you see and everything you hear and dream. This terror is personal, as you are beginning to understand. Vengeance is justice. The thunder is coming for you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Caliphornia<br><br>Caliphornia.<br><br>One short moment ago, when I'd first read this note, I'd felt a tingle in the scar above my left eye. I earned that scar in my first and last pro fight. Its moods have become a kind of early-warning system for danger ahead: use caution. Now it tingled again.<br><br>The death threat was handwritten in graceful cursive script that looked like a combination of English longhand and Arabic calligraphy. The letters slanted neither forward nor back but stood up straight. A calligraphic pen had been used to vary the thicknesses of line and curve. The loops were large and symmetrical. The lead-ins and tails of each word were thick, straight, and perfectly horizontal, as if traced over invisible guidelines. They began and ended in pointed, up-curved flourishes, like candle flames. The letter had arrived one day ago, on Saturday, December 8, in Lindsey's post office box in Las Vegas.<br><br>She set the envelope beside the letter. On the envelope were printed her name and her Las Vegas PO Box number. It was postmarked Wednesday, December 5, in San Diego, California. It had a Batman stamp and a return address that Lindsey had found to be World Pizza in Ocean Beach.<br><br>"Lindsey, this letter should be on an FBI light table, not on a PI's picnic table."<br><br>"Is it real? Do you believe it?"<br><br>"It's real and I believe it. You've got to take this to the FBI. The agents are trained to deal with this kind of thing."<br><br>"You know any of them?"<br><br>"One. Kind of."<br><br>A failed smile. "I'd sure appreciate it if you'd take this letter to them. I can't face law enforcement right now."<br><br>I tried to make sense of this request. It was strange and irrational that I was sitting here with a rattled young woman who had been threatened with death by a murderer-terrorist-psychopath-crackpot calling himself/herself Caliphornia, and who was now refusing to talk with the law. Strange and irrational that Lindsey would come to me first.<br><br>"Because of your son," I said.<br><br>Lindsey pulled off her sunglasses and tried to stare me down. Her temper is rarely distant. "Of course, my son. I've filed another request with the court for a custody amendment. You can only do that every eighteen months. I've been living clean as a Girl Scout, Roland. I'm teaching math at a private school, hitting the gym, no booze or dice. But Johnny's growing up without me. He's the whole reason I left here and moved back to Las Vegas. And if the court gets wind of this death threat, my custody petition gets red-flagged. The Bureau would poke around, right, talk to my employers. Investigate me. Right? Say good-bye to shared custody."<br><br>She was correct on those counts. I wondered about her Girl Scout claim because I'm suspicious by nature and profession.<br><br>"You saved me once, Roland, and I'm hoping you can do it again."<br><br>She slid her sunglasses back on.<br><br>Three years ago, Lindsey Rakes-then Lindsey Goff-had been flying Reaper drones out of Creech Air Force Base north of Las Vegas. She was the sensor operator. Or, as the drone flyers call them, simply a "sensor." Her missions as a sensor were often top secret and CIA-directed. Some were surveillance, some were kill-list strikes. Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan. Her flight crew called themselves the Headhunters. We flagged some bad guys, she had told me more than once.<br><br>Then, at the end of her contract in 2015, she quit the USAF against the wishes of her superiors. Experienced drone operators were in high demand at that time; the Air Force couldn't train them fast enough to keep up.<br><br>After six months as a civilian she'd fled to California, landed in the Pala Casino, and ended up renting a place here on my property. Back then, as we began to know and trust each other, she'd told me about her life at Creech: the six-day work weeks, the twelve-hour days, the strange psychosis brought on by sitting in an air-conditioned trailer in the desert and flying combat missions 7,500 miles away. Then heading off-base at sunrise to pick up something for breakfast and maybe some vodka, too, on her way home to husband, Brandon, and their young son, John. Little John. The light and anchor of her life. But not quite enough of an anchor.<br><br>Because some days, Lindsey had confessed, she'd get off work too nerve-shot and sickened to even look at her own son. And Brandon was always angry at her anyway. So instead of going home she'd blast off in her black Mustang GT, a wedding gift from her father, Lewis-"Hit Your Brakes for Rakes"-and race downtown to gamble hard, drink harder, and forget the things she'd seen and done in that cramped little trailer.<br><br>Until Brandon took Little John to a new home across town and filed divorce papers and a complaint of child neglect against her.<br><br>"How bitter was it?" I asked.<br><br>Behind the dark lenses, Lindsey studied me. "Very."<br><br>"And how is Brandon Goff's anger level these days, with your new move for joint custody?"<br><br>"No," she said. "Brandon wouldn't threaten me like this. He would do it clearly. Not hide behind a cryptic name and a threat."<br><br>Lindsey would know her ex well enough to judge his capacity for murder. Or would she? I'd seen enough people fooled by their spouses to always leave a door ajar.<br><br>I looked out at the gray December sky, the breeze-burred surface of the pond, the cattails wavering. Fall, I thought. The big hush. The time to exhale. Always makes me feel the speed of life. I tried to warm up to the idea of cutting off the head of a living human being with a knife. Thought of videos of fear-blanched men in orange jumpsuits forced to kneel in the dirt. Told myself that Christmas was coming soon, birth of Jesus and forgiveness of sin, peace on earth, joy to the world.<br><br>"Roland? I'm afraid. I've been to war but my life was never at stake. Weird, isn't it? But this has gotten to me. I have that Smith nine and know how to use it. I'd feel safe if I could land here for a while. This Caliphornia won't know where I am."<br><br>Lindsey and I had shot cans off rocks way out on the property here a few times, against a hillock, so the bullets wouldn't fly. She was pretty good against a can. When the target is human, of course, nerves change everything.<br><br>More important, I couldn't be sure that this so-called Caliphornia wouldn't find her here.<br><br>"You're in the public record of having lived here once," I said.<br><br>"Nobody quoted me."<br><br>"But the Union-Tribune named you as a tenant."<br><br>"One time was all. My name in the paper, once. And I never gave out this address when I was living here. Nobody. This was my secret hideout. Where you helped me put myself back together. Sort of back together." She wrung her thick ponytail, looking down at the table.<br><br>I remembered that night in the Pala Casino, later, when Lindsey crashed onto the stool next to me in one of those thinly peopled, regret-reeking bars found in casinos around the world. She looked like something the devil would eat for breakfast. Or had eaten.<br><br>"Welp," she'd said, curling a long finger at the bartender. "Lost it all."<br><br>"Maybe you should have stopped."<br><br>She had looked at me, eyes skeptical and held steady by force of will. "I'm Lindsey Rakes. You're obviously Saint Somebody. So the least you could say to someone who's just lost her last dollar is, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' Or 'I go.' Or however you saints say it."<br><br>After Lindsey Rakes had finished her drink I paid for it, got up, and offered to get her a casino hotel room, a taxi, or a ride home. House security was circling. She took option C. Out Highway 76 she told me she didn't have a home at precisely this minute, except for her Mustang, which, after a night in the backseat, made a woman her size feel like she'd been sawed in half by a bad magician.<br><br>"I didn't just lose the money," she had told me. "I've lost my son, my husband, my home, too. I can do without any of it except my son. John. Six years, seven months, and one day old. Not being able to see him is like living in a world where the sun won't rise. What did y'all say your name was?"<br><br>I hadn't, so I did.<br><br>"And how did you do at the tables tonight, Rolando?"<br><br>In fact, I hadn't gambled much at all. I'd come to the casino to observe a man suspected of embezzlement by his friend and business partner. They were a two-partner practice specializing in family law. I came to discover that the man who had hired me was in fact the embezzler, and the friend/partner he had "suspected" of the crime-and who had lost about five thousand dollars that night by my loose count-was an addicted gambler but a reasonably honest law partner.<br><br>I wasn't thrilled being stuck with a drunk hard-luck case who had nowhere to go, but I did what I thought was right. I usually do. It's a blessing and a curse.<br><br>"I can take you back to the casino hotel or put you up for the night," I had told her. "There's an empty casita on my property and it locks."<br><br>"Empty casita?"<br><br>"Furnished. I rent them out."<br><br>She was leaning back against the door of my pickup truck. The hills around us were dark. In the faint moon-and-dashboard glow I could see the pale shape of her face and the glint in her eyes as she deliberated. "Kinda Norman Batesy."<br><br>"Pretty much."<br><br>"You're big and not real pretty, but you don't look mean enough to worry about."<br><br>"It's the little pretty ones you have to watch."<br><br>"Marine?"<br><br>"Once upon a time."<br><br>"I was Air Force. Lieutenant Lindsey Rakes. I hate being this drunk."<br><br>I didn't have anything useful to say about Lieutenant Lindsey Rakes's drunkenness or hatred thereof. As a man who has overdone certain things in his life, I know that the world won't change, but you can. Over the six months she lived in my casita, I saw her battle the booze and the gambling and the Clark County Superior Court, which refused to allow Lindsey to visit her son more than one Saturday per month in a county facility adjacent to the jail. Lindsey had done okay with all that. Just barely okay.<br><br>Now, almost two years since I'd first met her, it felt right but also surreal to be making her the same offer again. You could say full circle, but nothing in life is round. "Your old casita is taken, but three and four are vacant."<br><br>"I've missed the Irregulars," she said.<br><br>I call my tenants the Irregulars because they tend to be non-regulation human beings. And a changing cast.<br><br>"And I remember casita three was always vacant," she said.<br><br>"For times like this."<br><br>"I can't pay you for protection, Roland. But I can make the rent."<br><br>"Don't worry about my time until we put a stop to this."<br><br>I set my phone on the table, searched "Caliphornia," got what I expected:<br><br>A picture of Governor Jerry Brown, wearing a mocked-up jeweled turban, "declaring himself caliph and establishing Sharia law in California." He was actually signing AB 2845, designed to shield students from bullying in public schools.<br><br>And:<br><br>Caliphornia, a self-published futuristic suspense novel about an Arab Caliphate and runaway global warming.<br><br>"Caliphornia," a song by Box O'Clox.<br><br>Barenakedislam.com, a website whose motto is "It isn't Islamaphobia when they really ARE trying to kill you."<br><br>Counter-Jihad T-Shirts with various anti-Muslim messages and images.<br><br>Such as Koran-Wipes toilet paper made from 100 percent recycled Korans.<br><br>Such as Hillary in a hijab.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>A fools' parade on the Internet.<br><br>Rage and volume turned up high.<br><br>Made me wonder how America was going to make it through the next week.<br><br>I shook my head, closed it all down. Looked up to find Lindsey watching me. "You still have Hall Pass Two?"<br><br>"You bet I do." My Cessna 182, to be more accurate. One of the older ones with the Lycoming engine and the bass roar of a beast when you punch it down the runway. I fly it for business and pleasure. There is a story behind it.<br><br>"And have you been really busy-privately investigating?"<br><br>"Just one open case right now," I said.<br><br>"Something exciting?"<br><br>"Oxley," I said, pointing to the poster that was stapled to one of the thick palm trunks that support the palapa. The poster featured a color photo of a hefty gray-striped cat. He looked peaceful. The photo was cropped so the cat seemed to sprawl in the middle of the flyer, as if lying on a cushion. MISSING CAT was the headline. The surrounding text explained that Oxley was missing from his Fallbrook home as of a week ago, that he was much loved, and that his owner-Tammy Bellamy-was heartbroken. Oxley had "hypnotic green eyes" and weighed twenty-two pounds. Tammy had given me a stack of the posters, all professionally printed on very heavy and expensive card-stock, to aid my search and post on my travels. Cats could go far, she'd explained. By the time I got my wanted posters, there were already scores of them put up in and around Fallbrook-on power poles, roadside oak trees, stop signs and traffic light stanchions, storefronts, shop windows, walls and fences. I'd stapled this one to the palapa so the Irregulars could keep their eyes out.</p><h2>National Sunday Law</h2><p><p>National Sunday Law explains exactly who the beast is, what the image of the beast is, and what the mark of the beast is. </p><p>A fascinating book and a must for anyone in search of the truth.

Every line of Fox's story, every gesture of her characters, is alive and surprising."&#x2015;Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <em>New York Times</em></strong></p> On the eve of their trip to Africa, Laura Maldonada Clapper and her husband, Desmond, sit in a New York City hotel room, drinking scotch-and-sodas and awaiting the arrival of three friends: Clara Hansen, Laura's timid, brow-beaten daughter from a previous marriage; Carlos, Laura's flamboyant and charming brother; and Peter Rice, a melancholy editor whom Laura hasn't seen for over a year. But what begins as a bon voyage party soon parlays into a bitter, claustrophobic clash of family resentment. From the hotel room to the tony restaurant to which the five embark, Laura presides over the escalating innuendo and hostility with imperial cruelty, for she is hiding the knowledge that her mother, the family matriarch, has died of a heart attack that morning. A novel as intense as it is unerringly observed, <em>The Widow's Children</em> is another revelation of the storyteller's art from the incomparable Paula Fox.</p><p>First published in 1976, <i>The Widow's Children</i>, with its unpalatable family wistfully gnashing at one another, has long defied critical description. Now that it's been rereleased, with a fine new introduction by Andrea Barrett, it's time again for readers to approach this spare--yet unsparing--novel. Approach with something like terror, or at least a tremulous respect, for Paula Fox's tale of one family's massive, various history awes with its marvelous compression. We learn these people inside and out in just one evening. Divided into seven chapters ("Drinks," "Corridor," "Restaurant," "The Messenger," "Two Brothers," "Clara," "The Funeral"), the book tells of the Maldonadas, Spanish-Cuban immigrants to America who now find themselves middle-aged and living in the past, galvanized only by sister Laura's emotional excesses. "These people," notes Peter, a friend, "had not signed <i>any</i> social contract."<p> Laura leads her husband, Desmond, her brother, Carlos, her daughter, Clara, and Peter a not-so-merry dance through one acrimonious dinner in a pretentious Manhattan restaurant. Practically the only ugly truth she doesn't manage to dredge up is the one she learned that very afternoon: Alma, Carlos and Laura's mother, has died in a nursing home. But the plot is not what we think about when we say this is a very, very good novel. Fox's marvelous control and formalism ultimately give <i>The Widow's Children</i> its strange, singular power. She has a poet's ability not just to imply unsayable mysteries but to imbue the unsaid with treachery, wit, emotion, and irony, all hanging in a vaporous cloud. Each character in turns speaks a pained monologue; we don't like them--we don't, in a sense, even care--but we can't stop watching this elaborately choreographed car wreck.</p><p> Along the way, Fox gets off a number of good ones, as in this description of a neighbor: "a tall muscular man who entered into and departed from rooms quickly, athletically, as though following a secret program of body building." Her wit leavens our impatience with these difficult people. And that's a clever swindle, for she then delivers a chilling tale with infinite grace. This is in no way an expected novel. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><p><strong>Paula Fox</strong> (1923&#x2015;2017) was the author of <em>Desperate Characters</em>, <em>The Widow&#x2019;s Children</em>, <em>A Servant&#x2019;s Tale</em>, <em>The God of Nightmares</em>, <em>Poor George</em>, <em>The Western Coast</em>, and <em>Borrowed Finery: A Memoir</em>, among other books.</p><p><strong>Andrea Barrett</strong> is the author of <em>The Air We Breathe</em>, <em>Servants of the Map</em> (finalist for the Pulitzer Prize), <em>The Voyage of the Narwhal</em>, <em>Ship Fever</em> (winner of the National Book Award), and other books.

Paris sketches the medieval history of the Iberian peninsula, stressing the tolerance of most of the Islamic dynasties, the relative amity between the three major religions of the area, and the flourishing culture that this relatively peaceful era nourished. The 14th century brought division within the Catholic Church itself; a plague that killed 25-30% of the population of Europe; and, in Valencia in 1391, a pogrom that gave its Jewish residents the choice of conversion or death. The &#34;end of days&#34; refers to the second coming of Christ, which would happen only if all the Jews were converted. Over half of the Jewish residents of Spain converted in the 14th and 15th centuries. These &#34;conversos&#34; were the primary target of the early Inquisition. Paris describes the early period of the Inquisition, the motives and actions of the inquisitors, and the fate of those accused. The actual expulsion of the Jews (not the conversos) in 1492 and the Moors (who were also given the opportunity to convert) in 1502 mark the climax of the events of this book.</p><p>This focus on the expulsion of the Jews from Spain traces the path of the Spanish Inquisition's lasting effects in the region. Before the reign of terror, Jews, Christians and Moors lived together in Spain in harmony: this title traces the underlying influences upon the decline of a rich and harmonious culture and the chain of events which followed. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Art &amp; Craft of Ceramics: Techniques, Projects, Inspiration (A Lark Ceramics Book)</h2><p>Beginners eager to explore the world of ceramics, as well as experienced potters seeking new techniques and ideas, will find this colorful, technique-packed manual absolutely inspiring. Lavishly illustrated and visually attractive, it provides both practical and creative information on tools and materials, production processes, glazing, and decorative techniques&#x2014;including detailed explanations of clays, kilns, and accessories. Explore essential methods for modeling (hand building, wheel turning); for decorating the pieces (slips, glazes, colored engobes); and for properly firing the finished piece at both low and high temperatures. Put all that new knowledge to work on six step-by-step projects&#x2014;from a large, oval sculpture formed by extrusion and wheel-throwing to a beautifully simple functional vessel&#x2014;all created by top ceramists.<br></p><p>A nice introduction to the artistic philosophies and goals of ceramics as an art form, Ros i Frigola's book presents a variety of ceramic styles in this general overview. The majority of the book covers materials, tools, and techniques, with a nice overview^B of the evolution of ceramics as an art form in the twentieth century. Readers will find a rich array of artists and styles throughout the text and illustrations, inspiring them to explore beyond the book. As the author states repeatedly, instruction and description are limited, given the breadth of the subject. What is covered, such concepts as melting point, plasticity, hardness, porosity, and shrinkage, is clearly illustrated. Ceramic instruction from a book is difficult, but Ros i Frigola does an admirable job explaining basic techniques. With lush photographs, Ros i Frigola's purpose--to inspire--is apparent. Readers, beginning or more experienced (the latter looking for a better understanding of the ways this medium can be used for artistic expression), will find edification. <i>Jennifer Palmer</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A large selection of historical writings illustrates the changing perceptions of the Druids through the centuries. They were disdained as bloodthirsty barbarians by the Roman writers who provide our (meager) historical accounts of them, but lionized by 17th- to 19th-century "antiquarian romantics" who essentially invented much of our modern notion of hooded, tree-worshipping sorcerers. The editor, a practicing Druid, also includes more sober but still readable academic studies that explore Druidic beliefs and rites and the legacy of Merlin legends, prophetic seers, weird dreams and witchy women inherited from Druidic motifs. Rounding out the anthology (which gathers selections from three earlier volumes, including The Druid Source Book and The Celtic Source Book) is a strong selection of legends, myths and poems, most from ancient and medieval Ireland and Wales, but including some modern writers inspired by the plangent tone and haunting, sometimes surreal imagery of early Celtic literature. Devotees of Druid philosophy, lovers of Gaelic lore and those interested in our very modern nostalgia for an enchanted past will all enjoy this book.

Born in the provinces, motivated by fictional romances, Colet ran off to Paris with an impoverished musician (to this day, her descendants, who have turned the family home into a golf resort, continue to disown her). In the heady world of salons, artists, and writers such as Victor Hugo, George Sand, and Alfred de Musset, the newcomer flourished as poet and dramatist. She had considerable renown when she met the unknown Flaubert, 11 years her junior, repressed, sexually conflicted, and syphilitic, who seduced her in hansom cabs, made fetishes of her slippers and hair, obsessed over her letters and then, in one dramatic moment, burned them all. The affair was brief, followed by a seven-year friendship, and here it's Flaubert's life, travels, opinions, and explicitly sexual letters (indeed, everyone's explicitly sexual letters) that take up most of the biography. There are informative side-essays on Parisian women, 19th-century women writers, and men's sexual relations--as well as interesting digressions on venereal disease and on sodomy in Egypt, where Flaubert traveled--making up a cultural history of sexual practices. Sadly, except for tantalizing allusions to Charlotte Corday and The Last Cleric--a scandalous attack on the Catholic Church--and some translations of her poetry, Colet's reputation as a ``literary star'' and feminist is obscured by her sexual history. A vivid and absorbing account--but Colet is as unsympathetic as Madame Bovary, remaining an unknown, misguided figure of unfulfilled passions and talents, a heroine in a naughty novel, famous for the scenes she made and the men she loved. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Louise Colet was a prolific writer and statuesque Frenchwoman with cascading blond hair, disconcerting blue eyes, a penchant for azure dresses, a fine mind, and a healthy sexual appetite. Colet was intent on escaping her stifling Provence home and giving her literary talent free range in Paris. Marriage was the only safe passage for a lady, so marriage it was, albeit an unsuccessful one. Once Colet reached Paris and made her writing debut, she took a lover with considerable clout in literary circles and began hosting a weekly salon. Colet had to use all her wiles to compete in the hypocritical and rather sordid high culture of mid-nineteenth-century Paris, where affairs such as hers were de rigueur. Du Plessix Gray superbly re-creates Colet's milieu and deftly portrays her lovers and colleagues, particularly her most famous conquest, the innovative novelist Flaubert. Colet endured Flaubert's selfishness and was, indeed, his muse and "midwife" to his most celebrated creation, Emma Bovary. Du Plessix Gray subjects their tempestuous relationship to close scrutiny, contrasting their temperaments and marveling at Colet's survival skills, generosity of spirit, and unflagging energy. On the other hand, she dubs her a "nineteenth-century Erica Jong who recklessly splashed her life and loves across her poetry and prose," but Colet is a paragon compared to the ruthless and sexually "cryptic and convoluted" Flaubert. Du Plessix Gray is absolutely dazzling here, by turns passionate and venomous, scholarly and outraged, ironic and empathic. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Sunday Lunch Club</h2><p>&#x2018;A warming testament to the elasticity and enduring love of true family bonds.

This stimulating new edition celebrates the play as a joyous exploration of language, but also places elements of its plot firmly in a continental, specifically Italian, tradition of romantic comedy. It draws out the complexities of Merry Wives as a multi-plot play, and takes a fresh and challenging look at both textual and dating issues. The play&#39;s extensive performance history, both dramatic and operatic, is fully explored and discussed.</p><p>Like every other play in the Cambridge School Shakespeare series, The Merry Wives of Windsor has been specially prepared to help all students in schools and colleges. This version aims to be different from other editions of the play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.According to legend, Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted with the character of Sir John Falstaff in <i>Henry IV,</i> Parts I and II, that she commanded Shakespeare to create a romantic comedy depicting the jolly old rogue in love. The obedient playwright responded with <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor,</i> a lively and enduring farce that offers a humorous rebuff to lechery and hypocrisy.<br>Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth. Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices&#x2014;romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities&#x2014;enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.<br>Dover (2014) unabridged republication of a standard edition.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p><h2>Speed and the Thoroughbred: The Complete History</h2><p>It has been said that the invention of the Thoroughbred was the single most consequential turning point in the evolution of the horse since its domestication. Its blood has provided the key to superiority in nearly every equestrian discipline. Why the Thoroughbred was created, how, by whom, and how its progenitors survived war, politics and the ambitions, jealousies of monarchs, noblemen and politicians is the subject of <i>Speed and the Thoroughbred</i>. Handsomely illustrated with paintings and photographs, this is the first book to identify and historically trace the three sources of Thoroughbred speed: the pre-Christian Irish Hobby, the 16th century English Running-Horse, and a few Middle-Eastern imports. More than ten years in the making, the author&#x2015;the most prolific equine author and creative equestrian of the 20th century&#x2015;believed it was his finest work of equine scholarship. It is the most important and fascinating book ever written about the Thoroughbred.</p><p>Alexander Mackay-Smith was born in Manhattan in 1903, but he lived most of his life in the horse country of Virginia. He is also the author of <i>The American Foxhound 1747-1967</i>, and <i>Foxhunting In North America</i>, among others. He died in 1998.This unexpected treasure comes from one of the equine world's most respected authors and students of history&#x2015;published two years after his death in 1998 at the age of 95. While many books have detailed the evolution of the Thoroughbred, in his final work Mackay-Smith takes a different angle in reviewing the origin of sprinting speed within the breed. The longtime editor of <i>The Chronicle of the Horse</i> magazine spent a decade researching, compiling, writing, and editing. The result is a posthumous masterpiece. This slim, slightly oversized volume is lushly illustrated in both black and white and color. (Mary Simon <i>Thoroughbred Times</i>)<br><br>Mackay-Smith's scholarly endeavor isn't just history, though. He raises a number of questions about the breeding of all kinds of horses that are as pertinent today as they were 400 years ago. (John Strassburger <i>The Chronicle Of The Horse</i>)<br><br>In relating the enthralling history of the origins of the thoroughbred, Mackay-Smith gives all horse lovers - not just racing enthusiasts - a fuller appreciation of the modern equine athlete. (<i>Faquier Times-Democrat</i>)<br><br>During his lifetime, Alexander Mackay-Smith contributed to sporting art and the sporting horse world in countless ways through his many books and as editor of <i>The Chronicle of the Horse.</i> The late Mackay-Smith's book, <i>Speed and the Thoroughbred,</i> contains 32 fine color prints and 28 black and white illustrations in a new edition.

The title is a reference to Sodom and Gomorrah</p><p></p><h2>Sir Francis Drake&#39;s West Indian Voyage, 1585-86 (Hakluyt Society, Second Series)</h2><p>Significant in the history of Anglo-Spanish relations and of English ventures was Drake&#39;s expedition to the West Indies in 1585-86. His raids on Spanish towns on both sides of the Atlantic were aimed not only to gather treasure but to bring a military challenge to the empire of Philip II. The voyage was linked also with the plantation projects of Raleigh, and ended with Drake bringing home the discouraged settlers of the first Virginia colony. Although not a financial success, the expedition attracted wide attention in England and the continent and was a prelude to the events of 1588. For over three centuries after the voyage the main source of information about it was the lively narrative, strongly propagandistic in tone, that was published in 1588 and 1589. In the present volume this account, attributed to Captain Walter Bigges, has been critically edited in the light of evidence now available from English and Spanish sources. Printed also are documents relating to ships and personnel and to financial accounts of the expedition. Included too are the journal from the vice-admiral&#39;s ship, the Primrose, edited from the original manuscript, the fragmentary journals from ships of two other major officers, and an important newsletter. Among illustrations are a previously unpublished map relating to Drake&#39;s stop at Vigo, as well as the Boazio maps, which are shown in differing sizes and details. Dr Keeler&#39;s introduction discusses the expedition in the context of Elizabethan policies in the pre-Armada years. She points out new evidence on Drake&#39;s administrative practices, on his negotiations with Spanish officials, and on his dealings with a troublesome rear-admiral. Appendices provide critical notes on the Boazio maps and on the circumstances of the publication of the Bigges account. This is a new print-on-demand hardback edition of the volume first published in 1981.</p><p>Mary Frear Keeler</p><h2>RuneScape: Legacy of Blood</h2><p>The city of Varrock is at breaking point; people are fleeing from the country into the already full city and riots are breaking out as the government struggles to keep order.<br><br>Meanwhile Gar'rth struggles with his dark destiny, Theodore chases a holy relic and Kara prepares for war.

Perfect music to accompany a rakishly handsome Blaxican as he made a poor imitation of his mother&#x2019;s salsa.

Back to begin her last year of Cultural Anthropology doctoral studies at the University of Oslo. I was still feeling buoyant from her visit. Like Paul blinded by righteousness and beauty.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The air in my house still carried her warm chocolate-and-pepper scent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I hadn&#x2019;t intended Tatina to see during her time in Detroit was a black Chevy Suburban, windows blackedout, crawling down Markham Street at ungodly hours of the morning. Tatina had casually noted the SUV twice during her nighttime bathroom visits.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; she asked over breakfast one morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Probably somebody coming home from a late shift somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I knew better.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Mexicantown.

Celia Cruz had just finished her sexy take on &#x201c;Oye Como Va.&#x201d; Now I was doing a rhumba bolero to James Brown&#x2019;s <i>Hot Pants-Pt. 1</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You need to learn the rhumba, Jimmy,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What I need to learn that goofy stuff for?&#x201d; Jimmy said, walking around me and retrieving an ice-cold bottle of water from my fridge. I kept bottled water in the fridge just for Jimmy and Carlos. They seemed never to be finished making little adjustments, improvements and additions to my house. I didn&#x2019;t really mind, since most of these were invisible to me. One of their last improvements made my house a virtual Wi-Fi hotspot for the other houses on Markham Street. Not a bad thing since most neighborhoods in Detroit were Internet dead zones.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found space in the fridge for four of the six jars of salsa and handed two to Jimmy. One for him, one for his loving landlords, my older neighbors Sylvia and Carmela.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You should sell this stuff,&#x201d; Jimmy said, scrutinizing the jars. &#x201c;Octavio&#x2019;s Genu-wine D-City Salsa.

Better than store-bought.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I said, knowing I wouldn&#x2019;t think about it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied with the success of my culinary mission, I grabbed a beer&#x2014;a Batch Brewing Vienna Lager&#x2014;and retired to the living room. Jimmy followed along, insisting on boring me with renovation status reports, material and equipment requests and subcontractor bids. We&#x2019;d just flipped two houses&#x2014;a detached brick three-bedroom to a young couple who&#x2019;d moved here from Portland with their three-year-old girl, and a two-bedroom brick duplex to some English charitable foundation guy who insisted on wearing his hair in a man-bun and doing yoga on his front porch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there were the inevitable local newspaper and magazine inquiries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This Renna Jacobs from the <i>Free Press</i>, man, she keep on calling me,&#x201d; Jimmy said. &#x201c;Wants to talk to you about bringin&#x2019; the &#x2019;hood back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t give her my number, did you?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, on account I know you&#x2019;d kill me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn straight,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Probably by making you give up Cheetos and Gatorade and force-feeding you healthy food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; Jimmy insisted. &#x201c;A little press be nice for the &#x2019;hood. <i>And </i>for me and Carlos. I mean, we all got to think outside the Markham Street box, Mr. Snow. One house left to reno and flip on the street&#x2014;then what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy had just asked a question that I&#x2019;d been avoiding for the past three months. I never intended for house renovations in the southwest Detroit neighborhood of Mexicantown to become my purpose in life. I just wanted my neighborhood&#x2014;my street&#x2014;back. Maybe homage to my beloved parents. Maybe reverence for a long-ago way of life that in this moment seemed to hold no more weight than spirits wandering far from their graves.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being fired from the Detroit Police Department, the trial that followed and my twelve-million-dollar wrongful dismissal award, I&#x2019;d wanted nothing more than to isolate my shattered self in a safe place. That had been the whole reason I&#x2019;d renovated my childhood home on Markham Street in the first place, and then, by extension, the neighboring houses toward Mexicantown&#x2019;s business thoroughfare, Vernor Avenue.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Markham Street&#x2014;and August Octavio Snow&#x2014;2.0.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I had a couple good men depending on me for their livelihood.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I had no answers for them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy gave me a sideways look that said he&#x2019;d heard this from me before. &#x201c;Yeah, well, either way,&#x201d; Jimmy said, tearing a small portion of paper from his work notebook and handing the shred to me, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s that reporter&#x2019;s number. A &#x2018;neighborhood renaissance,&#x2019;&#x201d; Jimmy persisted. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what this reporter lady calls what you done did around here.

Toward the end of World War I, while working from his studio in Cologne, Sander began what would become his life's work: a photographic portrait of German society under the Weimar Republic. He called this endeavor <i>People of the 20th Century</i>. While his first publication was banned from sale in 1936 by the Nazi government, around 1938 Sander began taking identity photographs for persecuted Jews. During World War II he photographed migrant workers; Sander included these images, alongside some taken by his son Erich from the prison where he would die in 1944, plus portraits of National Socialists made before and during the war, in <i>People of the 20th Century</i>.</p><p>Sander was unable to publish his monumental work during his lifetime, and these photographs are published together for the first time here, along with contact prints, letters and details about the lives of those photographed. They are portraits of dignified men and women, victims of an ideology taking their rightful place as "People of the 20th Century" in defiance of Nazi efforts to ostracize them.</p><p>The son of a miner from Herdorf, Germany, <b>August Sander</b> (1876&#x2013;1964) moved to Cologne in 1910 and established a studio as a portrait photographer there. In 1929 he published <i>Antlitz der Zeit</i> (Face of our time), a collection of 60 portraits constituting a sociological inventory of German society in the 1920s, which the Nazis eventually banned. In 1938&#x2013;39 Sander took numerous identity photographs for Jews in Cologne; after the war he added 12 of these to his oeuvre under the title <i>The Persecuted</i>. Sander died in 1964, leaving behind a chronicle and sociological inventory of his time in more than 40,000 photos.</p></p><p>Each photograph is presented with equal value, the elite placed alongside the commoner, the murderer and the victim, the persecuted next to the persecutors.

His first major collection--<i>Traveling Through the Dark</i>--won the National Book Award. He published more than sixty-five volumes of poetry and prose and was Poetry Consultant to the Library of Congress-a position now known as the Poet Laureate. Before his death in 1993, he gave his son Kim the greatest gift and challenge: to be his literary executor. </p><p>In <i>Early Morning</i>, Kim creates an intimate portrait of a father and son who shared many passions: archery, photography, carpentry, and finally, writing itself. But Kim also confronts the great paradox at the center of William Stafford's life. The public man, the poet who was always communicating with warmth and feeling-even with strangers-was capable of profound, and often painful, silence within the family. By piecing together a collage of his personal and family memories, and sifting through thousands of pages of his father's daily writing and poems, Kim illuminates a fascinating and richly lived life.</p></p><p><p><b>William Stafford</b> was born in Kansas in 1914, and published over fifty books of poetry and prose. </p><p><b>Kim Stafford</b> is a writer and director of the Northwest Writing Institute at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Oregon.</p>*Starred Review* Writing with the same elegant precision that distinguished his collection of personal essays, <i>Having Everything Right</i> (1986), Stafford remembers his father, poet William Stafford, through a creative blend of memoir, poetry, and criticism. "His words seemed plain to some, his subjects ordinary," Stafford writes of his father's poems, which often celebrated the landscapes of his native Kansas and his inherited Oregon. "His response was to offer as an alternative to the loud and aggressive a quiet language of reconciliation." That profound quiet and that hard-won reconciliation--with nature, with other people, with himself--is everywhere evident in this moving account of the man and his work. Stafford spent WW II in a camp for conscientious objectors and was reviled by friends as a "conchie." His pacifism was unwavering, however, and became one of the hallmarks of his poetry and his character. If Stafford's story is free of confrontation, it is not free of tragedy. Moving fluidly from his father's poems and "daily writing" to memories of his life, Kim recalls the suicide of his older brother and its effect on the family. If quiet brought power to Stafford's poems, his often-protracted silence sometimes brought distance to his relations with his loved ones. And, yet, there is something touching and intimate about witnessing the son using his own words to bridge his father's silence. For anyone who has read William Stafford's verse and marveled at the way he could capture the pulse and power of life, his son's words help reveal the source of that power: "My father used to say that poems are not made of words, but of contexts." This remarkable tribute gives new life to those contexts. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

All previous lives of Napoleon have relied more on the memoirs of others than on his own uncensored words. Michael Broers&#39; biography draws on the thoughts of Napoleon himself as his incomparable life unfolded. It reveals a man of intense emotion, but also of iron self-discipline; of acute intelligence and immeasurable energy. Tracing his life from its dangerous Corsican roots, through his rejection of his early identity, and the dangerous military encounters of his early career, it tells the story of the sheer determination, ruthlessness and careful calculation that won him the precarious mastery of Europe by 1807. After the epic battles of Austerlitz, Jena and Friedland, France was the dominant land power on the continent. Here is the first life in which Napoleon speaks in his own voice, but not always as he wanted the world to hear him.</p><p>Michael Broers is Professor of Western European History at Oxford University. He is the author of, among other books about revolutionary and Napoleonic Europe, The Napoleonic Empire in Italy, 1796-1814, winner of the Grand Prix Napoleon prize, 2006, and of Napoleon&#39;s Other War: Bandits, Rebels and their Pursuers in the Age of Revolutions&#x201c;Breathtaking.

This segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire has shaped not only the physical landscape of the region but also the psychological landscape, and with it the narratives we compose about ourselves. <i>Exceptional Mountains</i> is a cultural history of the Northwest volcanoes and the environmental impact of outdoor recreation in this region. It probes the relationship between these volcanoes and regional identity, particularly in the era of mass mountaineering and population growth in the Northwest.<br> &nbsp;<br> O. Alan Weltzien demonstrates how mountaineering is but one conspicuous example of the outdoor recreation industry&#x2019;s unrestricted and problematic growth. He explores the implications of our assumptions that there are no limits to our outdoor recreation habits and that access to the highest mountains should include amenities for affluent consumers. Each chapter probes the mountain-based regional ethos and the concomitant sense of privilege and entitlement from different vantages to illuminate the consumerist mind-set as a reductive&#x2014;and deeply problematic&#x2014;version of experience and identity in and around some of the nation&#x2019;s most striking mountains.</p></p><p><b>O.

(in color) + 224 pp. profusely illus. in color &amp; b/w, 8vo.</p><p>"Yes, my dear people, I have set my first footfall in the East, and oh! that I could tell you the new world of old poetry, of Bible images, of light, and life, and beauty which that word opens." <p>Florence Nightingale was twenty-nine when she visited Egypt in the winter of 1849-50 with her friends Charles and Selina Bracebridge. A journey to the fabled land of the Arabian Nights was a fantastic adventure at that time, and Florence wrote long, picturesque letters to her family describing her visit and her views of the country, its history and its people. These letters were edited and privately printed by her sister, Parthenope, in 1854 and were greatly admired by those who read them, but they have never before been published. </p><p>Attractive, intelligent and extremely well read, Miss Nightingale was one of the earliest women to make such a journey, and she researched her subject well. Her letters are a fascinating account of life in a country whose greatest asset, its past, had only recently been discovered. They are also a valuable record of a way of life that has now vanished. And they are an extraordinary account into the character of a woman who within five years was to become a legend. </p><p>The brilliant landscapes and unimaginable colors of Egypt also drew artists from all over Europe, and Letters from Egypt is illustrated throughout with the glorious paintings and lithographs of David Roberts, Theodore Frere, Edward Lear and others. </p><p>Anthony Sattin, who has an MA in Creative Writing from the University of East Anglia, is a writer and journalist who lives in London. He discovered and edited An Englishwoman in India: Memoirs of Harriet Tyler, published in 1986, and among his other published works are Lifting the Veil: The British in Egypt 1768-1956, and The Pharaoh's Shadow, which discusses how ancient Egyptian practices have influenced modern customs in that country. He has also written travel guidebooks to Egypt and the Greek Islands for AAA Essential Guides and Fodor's with his wife Sylvie Franquet. He is a regular contributor to the travel and book sections of The Sunday Times (London).</p>Nightingale, well known for her dedication to and reform of nursing, was also a prolific letter writer. In November 1849 she spent five months sailing from Alexandria to Abu Simbel and back. On that journey she wrote many letters to her family in England, vividly and in great detail describing the ruins, the environment, the lives of the people, and the politics of Egypt. The letters were "circulated" by her sister in 1854 and are now published for the first time. Many sketches and colored paintings of 19th-century Egypt appropriately illustrate the narrative. A visually and intellectually satisfying book recommended to academic and large public libraries.

An expert on nineteenth-century French literature and culture, she also trained for years in Paris as an artist and printmaker. She has taught at Yale and the University of Colorado, where she is Associate Professor of French. She divides her time between New York, Boulder and Paris.Stiff and hobbled by its own exhaustiveness, this biography of Paris's tiny painter/provocateur (18641901) takes lively material and renders it lifeless. Frey (French/Univ. of Colorado, Boulder) raided a trove of newly released Toulouse-Lautrec family letters for this life study. Writing to his dear ``Maman'' and other dotty family members, the painter reveals himself only in the most guarded terms. He presents a foppish self-caricature, one that pokes fun at his own dwarfism, aristocratic background, and artistic pretensions. Frey provides more than ample surrounding historical context. She discusses thoroughly the wealthy Toulouse-Lautrec bloodline, its possible genetic inbreeding, and prickly family dynamic. Lively illustrations throughout enrich the text, and in art historical matters Frey, who has training as a printmaker, is most solid. Paris's period atelier system is depicted with some color. A sensible account of Toulouse-Lautrec's technical development follows, particularly strong in its analysis of the liberating effect that lithography had on the artist's work and its role in propagating his public image. Examined at length are Toulouse- Lautrec's possible influences: the formidable shadow of Edgar Degas, the development of still photography, the radical perspectival schemes introduced to Westerners by Japanese prints, and the philosophical convictions of the social realist and art nouveau movements. Less convincing are the author's constant attempts to second-guess Toulouse-Lautrec's psychological motivations for depicting his chosen subjects--the performers and prostitutes of Paris's bohemian Montmartre--and her ceaseless harping on his chronic alcoholism, possible sex life, and probable syphilitic condition. Frey includes extraneous detail to the point of annoyance. No true sense of Toulouse-Lautrec the person emerges. Painstaking and scrupulously scholarly without managing to be evocative.

But her voyage to the colony of Nova Esperium is cut short when she is shanghaied and stranded on Armada, a legendary floating pirate city. Bellis becomes the reader's unbelieving eyes as she reluctantly learns to live on the gargantuan flotilla of stolen ships populated by a rabble of pirates, mercenaries, and press-ganged refugees. Meanwhile, Armada and Bellis's future is skippered by the "Lovers," an enigmatic couple whose mirror-image scarring belies the twisted depth of their passion.

But the journey is not theirs alone. They are joined by a handful of travelers, each with a reason for fleeing the city. Among them is Bellis Coldwine, a renowned linguist whose services as an interpreter grant her passage&#x2014;and escape from horrific punishment. For she is linked to Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin, the brilliant renegade scientist who has unwittingly unleashed a nightmare upon New Crobuzon.</p><p>For Bellis, the plan is clear: live among the new frontiersmen of the colony until it is safe to return home. But when the ship is besieged by pirates on the Swollen Ocean, the senior officers are summarily executed. The surviving passengers are brought to Armada, a city constructed from the hulls of pirated ships, a floating, landless mass ruled by the bizarre duality called the Lovers. On Armada, everyone is given work, and even Remades live as equals to humans, Cactae, and Cray. Yet no one may ever leave.</p><p>Lonely and embittered in her captivity, Bellis knows that to show dissent is a death sentence. Instead, she must furtively seek information about Armada's agenda.

Some took detours that reflected the times (Elsie the Cow was sent into outer space in 1958). Some were fashion victims who survived (remember hippy Hush Puppies, circa 1969?). And some are no longer with us (the Frito Bandito was finally brought to justice in 1971). These endearingly offbeat characters are as fresh and entertaining today as they were creatively inspired in decades past.</p><p>WARREN DOTZ is a pop culture historian and the author of eight books on advertising art. As an authority on product label art, his commentary has appeared in <i>Advertising Age, Brandweek,</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i> He lives and works in Berkeley, California. <br><br>MASUD HUSAIN is a graphic designer, branding specialist, and avid collector of American advertising ephemera. He coauthored Meet Mr. Product with Warren Dotz. He lives and works in Albany, California.INTRODUCTION<br><br>There is a classic axiom among ad men: "Don't sell the steak, sell the sizzle." In other words-don't sell the product, sell the feeling-it isn't about what's for sale, it's about the emotional response of the customer who's being courted.<br><br>Perhaps that's why, in an increasingly unpredictable world, the friendly faces and forms of the critters and characters in the print ads and TV commercials we grew up with seem so reassuring. But why do they reach us in ways other images don't? Familiarity? Certainly. They've been coming into our homes (and our heads) through magazines and television since the 1950s. But nostalgia isn't the only reason we think fondly of these imaginative creations. Commercial images and slogans, some of which even attained the status of pop-culture icons, were often cleverly amusing, but they weren't made to entertain, although that was often a by-product. Company mascots were advertising ambassadors created not only to entice people to acquire a product or use a service, but also to brand or differentiate their products from the competition-even if there was little distinction.<br><br>Product characters were designed to comfort consumers, to reassure them that they were making the smartest, safest, best-quality choices and thus were wise, secure, good people. Whatever form it took-human, animal, vegetable, or inanimate object each was given a personality that an eager audience would find easy to relate to and even easier to identify with the product or service it represented. After all, what homemaker wouldn't want the muscle power of a very buff and immaculately groomed Mr. Clean? Surely Mr. Peanut's dapper top hat, monocle, and spats would elevate the once lowly goober to the status of swanky snack, wouldn't he? (Mr. P's spit-and-polish appearance has remained undimmed for decades, by the way.) What about the stylish, European sophistication of Paul Rand's Dubonnet ads? They were meant to remind middle-class Americans of their upwardly mobile aspirations. And there's the Land-O-Lakes Indian maiden who hasn't aged a day and is as freshly youthful, and therefore as promising of freshness, as ever.<br><br>It's important to recall that prior to the 1950s manufacturers did not market to children. After all, kids didn't have money to spend, so why spend money on them? But as baby boomers populated the burgeoning suburbs and television reached out for the hearts and minds of America's offspring, a vast, heretofore untapped audience for new merchandise was discovered. Advertisers took note and kids were targeted to sway their parents' spending. <br><br>Thus, kid-friendly critters proliferated faster than you could say Froot Loops! Smokey the Bear (who was based on a very real, wild orphaned cub), was transformed into a creature as cute and cuddly as any toy teddy; the Kool-Aid Pitcher was portrayed with a permanent smile on what should have been a fleetingly frosty face; and tykes all over the country identified with the fractious foibles of the Trix Rabbit and his endless quest for sweet cereal treats. These characters became not only familiar-they were trusted. They were, in a sense, the visual equivalent of comfort food and helped shepherd a young generation through uncertain times.<br><br>Not every mascot achieved the status of icon. Some of these long forgotten faces once fronted for now defunct companies. And in some cases, the business is still in business, but its mascot or pitchman has long since retired. Strangely (or perhaps not so strangely) some of the characters are not only recognizable, they would look perfectly at home in today's marketing campaigns. Why couldn't Tuffy Tooth make a comeback for Colgate and fight dental battles right alongside the other toothpaste brands? And who would say no to Miss Fluffy if she returned to preside over the next batch of rice you make for dinner?<br><br>So, look a little closer when you pick up a box, bottle, or can and watch a little more attentively when the hapless AFLAC Goose flaps across the screen or the GEICO Geko chats in his charming cockney accent. They're part of a modern legacy of an old tradition and one we celebrate in the pages that follow.</p><h2>Emily of New Moon/ Emily Climbs/ Emily&#39;s Quest (3 Book Set)</h2><p>EMILY OF NEW MOON Emily Starr never knew what it was to be lonely until her beloved father died.

His novel The Ballad of Dingus Magee was made into the film Dirty Dingus Magee, which starred Frank Sinatra, and he is also the author of three crime novels.

Sitting at a typewriter in a beach house day after uncharted dayshe keeps no calendar or clocksshe pours out her thoughts on music, art and ancient Greek legends, and remembrances of her travels across the globe in abandoned cars, looking for other living beings. But after a while, some discrepancies creep into her rambling, compelling monologue: an accident that she first says took place in New York now occurs in Leningrad; memories become distorted by imaginings. Were they ever really memories in the first place? By the end of this seamless stream of consciousness, there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, past and present.

Each page features a different part of the freight train in a bright color. Then the whole train moves through the countryside, faster and faster until the colors start to blur from the speed.

Next, the different cars on the train are given names, so young engineers will recognize them when they see a real freight train. They are introduced to the engine and tender (in hard-working black), a hopper car, a tanker car, a flat car, and so on all the way to the red caboose in back.</p><p><p>In powerful words and vibrant illustrations, Donald Crews evokes the essence of inexorably rolling wheels, so that even a child not lucky enough to have counted freight cars will feel he has watched a freight train passing.</p><p>A book truly for the youngest child -- and for every one of us who has been that child.</p><p>Donald Crews is the renowned creator of many celebrated children's books, including the Caldecott Honor Books <em>Freight Train</em> and <em>Truck</em>.

Our instinct is to bolt our doors and protect the ones we love. But deep within the heart of Benedictine spirituality lies a remedy to hatred, fear, and suspicion: hospitality. At once deeply comforting and sharply challenging, true Benedictine hospitality requires that we welcome the stranger, not only into our homes, but into our hearts. With warmth and humor, drawing from the monastic tradition and sharing personal anecdotes from their own lives, Pratt and Homan encourage us to embrace not only the literal stranger, but the stranger within and the stranger in those we love.</p><p><p>Begin to live this radical vision for a kinder world. . .</p><p>There is no need to be afraid as we walk through life -- afraid of the unknown, the unexpected, even other people.

From the tall, lanky new lawyer who tucked his papers inside his stovepipe hat to the president who led a divided country through civil war, Harness profiles a personal and political Lincoln in a variety of settings and states of mind. Her informal style lends a familiarity to the narrative, interspersing quotes, excerpts, anecdotes, and speeches into the straightforward story line. Without romanticizing Lincoln's role in history, the author allows this larger-than-life president to be human by presenting the anguish and torment he suffered at home as well as in his role as president during a time of civil war. Illustrated maps rife with captions and dates outline the chronology of events and provide a jumping-off point for more serious war buffs. An enormous amount of information and a number of complex issues are pared down to an approachable, satisfying sketch of the simple country lawyer who became ``Father Abraham, the Emancipator.''

Starting with the question <i>Who is responsible for this? </i>the book&nbsp;looks at breeders, breed associations, instructors, judges, riders, spectators,&nbsp;and the governing bodies of horse sports.

Then, as quickly and inexplicably as it had struck, the disease&#x2013;dubbed Transcription Divergence Syndrome (TDS)&#x2013;vanished, leaving behind a population divided into three new branches of humanity: giant gray-skinned argos, hairless seal-like betas, and grotesquely obese charlies.<br><br>Paxton Abel Martin was fourteen when TDS struck, killing his mother, transforming his preacher father into a charlie, and changing one of his best friends, Jo Lynn, into a beta.

But there are even darker&#x2013;and far weirder&#x2013;mysteries hiding below the surface that will threaten not only Pax&#x2019;s future but the future of the whole human race.</p><p>Daryl Gregory's first novel, <b>Pandemonium</b>, was published in 2008 and won the 2009 Crawford Award, given each year by critics and scholars of the fantasy field to "an oustanding new fantasy writer whose first book was published the previous year." The book was also a finalist for The Shirley Jackson Award, the Locus Award, and the Mythopoeic Award for best fantasy adult novel. Gregory's short stories have appeared in The <i>Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i>, <i>Asimov's</i>, several year's-best anthologies, and other fine venues. In 2005 Gregory recieved the <i>Asimov's</i> Readers' Award for the novelette "Second Person, Present Tense." He lives with his wife and two children in State College, Pennsylvania, where he writes both fiction and web code.<i>Chapter One</i><br>Pax knew he was almost to Switchcreek when he saw his first argo.<br><br>The gray-skinned man was hunched over the engine of a decrepit, roofless pickup truck stalled hood-up at the side of the road. He straightened as Pax's car approached, unfolding like an extension ladder. Ten or eleven feet tall, angular as a dead tree, skin the mottled gray of weathered concrete. No shirt, just overalls that came down to his bony knees. He squinted at Pax's windshield.<br><br>Jesus, Pax thought. He'd forgotten how big they were.<br><br>He didn't recognize the argo, but that didn't mean much, for a lot of reasons. He might even be a cousin. The neighborly thing would be to pull over and ask the man if he needed help. But Pax was running late, so late. He fixed his eyes on the road outside his windshield, pretending not to see the man, and blew past without touching his brakes. The old Ford Tempo shuddered beneath him as he took the next curve.<br><br>The two-lane highway snaked through dense walls of green, the trees leaning into the road. He'd been gone for eleven years, almost twelve. After so long in the north everything seemed too lush, too overgrown. Subtropical. Turn your back and the plants and insects would overrun everything.<br><br>His stomach burned from too much coffee, too little food, and the queasy certainty that he was making a mistake. The call had come three days ago, Deke's rumbling voice on his cell phone's voice mail: Jo Lynn was dead. The funeral was on Saturday morning. Just thought you'd want to know.<br><br>Pax deleted the message but spent the rest of the week listening to it replay in his head. Dreading a follow-up call. Then 2 a.m. Saturday morning, when it was too late to make the service--too late unless he drove nonstop and the Ford's engine refrained from throwing a rod--he tossed some clothes into a suitcase and drove south out of Chicago at 85 mph.<br><br>His father used to yell at him, Paxton Abel Martin, you'd be late for your own funeral! It was Jo who told him not to worry about it, that everybody was late for their own funeral. Pax didn't get the joke until she explained it to him. Jo was the clever one, the verbal one.<br><br>At the old town line there was a freshly painted sign: welcome to switchcreek, tn. population 815. The barbed wire fence that used to mark the border was gone. The cement barriers had been pushed to the roadside. But the little guard shack still stood beside the road like an outhouse, abandoned and drowning in kudzu.<br><br>The way ahead led into what passed for Switchcreek's downtown, but there was a shortcut to where he was going, if he could find it. He crested the hill, scanning the foliage to his right, and still almost missed it. He braked hard and turned in to a narrow gravel drive that vanished into the trees. The wheels jounced over potholes and ruts, forcing him to slow down.<br><br>The road forked and he turned left automatically, knowing the way even though yesterday he wouldn't have been able to describe this road to anyone. He passed a half-burned barn, then a trailer that had been boarded up since he was kid, then the rusted carcass of a '63 Falcon he and Deke had used for target practice with their .22s. Each object seemed strange, then abruptly familiar, then hopelessly strange again--shifting and shifty.<br><br>The road came out of the trees at the top of a hill. He braked to a stop, put the car in park. The engine threatened to die, then fell into an unsteady idle.<br><br>A few hundred yards below lay the cemetery, the redbrick church, and the gravel parking lot half-full of cars. Satellite trucks from two different television stations were there. In the cemetery, the funeral was already in progress.<br><br>Pax leaned forward and folded his arms atop the steering wheel, letting the struggling air conditioner blow into his damp ribs. About fifty people sat or stood around a pearl-gray casket. Most were betas, bald, dark-red heads gleaming like river stones. The few men wore dark suits, the women long dresses. Some of the women had covered their heads with white scarves. A surprising number of them seemed to be pregnant.<br><br>An argo couple stood at the rear of the group, towering over the other mourners. The woman's broad shoulders and narrow hips made a V of her pale green dress. The man beside her was a head shorter and skinny as a ladder. He wore a plain blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up his chalky forearms. Deke looked exactly as Pax remembered him.<br><br>The people who were seated rose to their feet. They began to sing.<br><br>Pax turned off the car and rolled down the window. Some of the voices were high and flutelike, but the bass rumble, he knew, was provided by the booming chests of the two argos. The melody was difficult to catch at first, but then he recognized the hymn "Just As I Am." He knew the words by heart. It was an altar-call song, a slow weeper that struck especially hard for people who'd come through the Changes. Leading them through the song, her brickred face tilted to the sky, was a beta woman in a long skirt, a flowing white blouse, and a colorful vest. The pastor, Pax guessed, though it was odd to think of a woman pastor at this church. It was odd to think of anyone but his father in the pulpit.<br><br>When the song ended the woman said a few words that Pax couldn't catch, and then the group began to walk toward the back door of the church. As the rows cleared, two figures remained seated in front of the casket: two bald girls in dark dresses. Some of the mourners touched the girls' shoulders and moved on.<br><br>Those had to be the twins. Jo's daughters. He'd known he'd see them here, had braced for it, but even so he wasn't ready. He was grateful for this chance to see them first from a distance.<br><br>A bald beta man in a dark blue suit squatted down between the girls, and after a brief exchange took their hands in<br><br>his. They stood and he led them to the church entrance. The argo couple hung back. They bent their heads together, and then the woman went inside alone, ducking to make it through the entrance. Deke glanced up to where Paxton's car sat on the hill.<br><br>Pax leaned away from the windshield. What he most wanted was to put the car in reverse, then head back through the trees to the highway. Back to Chicago. But he could feel Deke looking at him.<br><br>He stepped out of the car, and hot, moist air enveloped him. He reached back inside and pulled out his suit jacket--frayed at the cuffs, ten years out of style--but didn't put it on. If he was lucky he wouldn't have to wear it at all.<br><br>"Into the valley of death," he said to himself. He folded the jacket over his arm and walked down the hill to the cemetery's rusting fence.<br><br>The back gate squealed open at his push. He walked through the thick grass between the headstones. When he was a kid he'd used this place like a playground. They all had--Deke, Jo, the other church kids--playing hide and seek, sardines, and of course ghost in the graveyard. There weren't so many headstones then.<br><br>Deke squatted next to the grave, his knees higher than his head like an enormous grasshopper. He'd unhooked one of the chains that had connected the casket to the frame and was rolling it up around his hand. "Thought that was you," he said without looking up from his work. His voice rumbled like a diesel engine.<br><br>"How you doing, Deke."<br><br>The man stood up. Pax felt a spark of fear--the back-brain yip of a small mammal confronted with a much larger predator. Argos were skinny, but their bony bodies suggested scythes, siege engines. And Deke seemed to be at least a foot taller than the last time Pax had seen him. His curved spine made his head sit lower than his shoulders, but if he could stand up straight he'd be twice Paxton's height.<br><br>"You've grown," Pax said. If they'd been anywhere near the same size they might have hugged--normal men did that all the time, didn't they? Then Deke held out a hand the size of a skillet, and Pax took it as best he good. Deke could have crushed him, but he kept his grip light. His palm felt rough and unyielding, like the face of a cinderblock. "Long time, P.K.," he said.<br><br>P.K. Preacher's Kid. Nobody had called him that since he was fifteen. Since the day he left Switchcreek.<br><br>Pax dropped his arm. He could still feel the heat of Deke's skin on his palm.<br><br>"I didn't get your message until last night," Pax lied. "I drove all night to get here. I must look like hell."<br><br>Deke tilted his head, not disagreeing with him. "The important thing's you got here. I told the reverend I'd take care of the casket, but if you want to go inside, they're setting out the food."<br><br>"No, that's--I'm not hungry." Another lie. But he hadn't come here for a hometown reunion. He needed to pay his respects and that was it. He was due back at the restaurant by Monday.<br><br>He looked at the casket, then at the glossy, polished gravestone. Someone had paid for a nice one.<br><br>JO LYNN WHITEHALL<br><br>BORN FEBRUARY 12, 1983<br><br>DIED AUGUST 17, 2010<br><br>LOVING MOTHER<br><br>"'Loving Mother.' That's nice," Pax said. But the epitaph struck him as entirely inadequate. After awhile he said, "It seems weird to boil everything down to two words like that."<br><br>"Especially for Jo," Deke said. A steel frame supported the casket on thick straps. Deke squatted again to turn a stainless steel handle next to the screw pipe. The casket began to lower into the hole. "It's the highest compliment the betas have, though. Pretty much the only one that counts."<br><br>The casket touched bottom. Paxton knelt and pulled up the straps on his side of the grave. Then the two of them lifted the metal frame out of the way.<br><br>Paxton brushed the red clay from his knees. They stood there looking into the hole.<br><br>The late Jo Lynn Whitehall, Paxton thought.<br><br>He tried to imagine her body inside the casket, but it was impossible. He couldn't picture either of the Jos he'd known--not the brown-haired girl from before the Changes, or the sleek creature she'd become after. He waited for tears, the physical rush of some emotion that would prove that he loved her. Nothing came. He felt like he was both here and not here, a double image hovering a few inches out of true.<br><br>Paxton breathed in, then blew out a long breath. "Do you know why she did it?" He couldn't say the word "suicide."<br><br>Deke shook his head. They were silent for a time and then Deke said, "Come on inside."<br><br>Deke didn't try to persuade him; he simply went in and Pax followed, down the narrow stairs--the dank, cinderblock walls smelling exactly as Pax remembered--and into the basement and the big open room they called the Fellowship Hall. The room was filled with rows of tables covered in white plastic tablecloths. There were at least twice as many people as<br><br>he'd seen outside at the burial. About a dozen of them were "normal"--unchanged, skipped, passed over, whatever you wanted to call people like him--and none of them looked like reporters.<br><br>Deke went straight to the buffet, three tables laid end-<br><br>to-end and crowded with food. No one seemed to notice that Pax had snuck in behind the tall man.<br><br>The spread was as impressive as the potlucks he remembered as a boy. Casseroles, sloppy joes, three types of fried chicken, huge bowls of mashed potatoes . . . One table held nothing but desserts. Enough food to feed three other congregations.<br><br>While they filled their plates Pax surreptitiously looked over the room, scanning for the twins through a crowd of alien faces. After so long away it was a shock to see so many of the changed in one room. TDS--Transcription Divergence Syndrome--had swept through Switchcreek the summer he was fourteen. The disease had divided the population, then divided it again and again, like a dealer cutting a deck of cards into smaller piles. By the end of the summer a quarter of the town was dead. The survivors were divided by symptoms into clades: the giant argos, the seal-skinned betas, the fat charlies. A few, a very few, weren't changed at all--at least in any way you could detect.<br><br>A toddler in a Sunday dress bumped into his legs and careened away, laughing in a high, piping voice. Two other bald girls--all beta children were girls, all were bald--chased after her into a forest of legs.<br><br>Most of the people in the room were betas. The women and the handful of men were hairless, skin the color of cabernet, raspberry, rose. The women wore dresses, and now that he was closer he could see that even more were pregnant than he'd supposed. The expectant mothers tended to be the younger, smaller women. They were also the ones who seemed to be wearing the head scarves.<br><br>He was surprised by how different the second-generation daughters were from their mothers. The mothers, though skinny and bald and oddly colored, could pass for normal women with some medical condition--as chemo patients, maybe. But their children's faces were flat, the noses reduced to a nub and two apostrophes, their mouths a long slit.<br><br>Someone grabbed his arm. "Paxton Martin!"<br><br>He put on an expectant smile before he turned.<br><br>"It is you," the woman said. She reached up and pulled him down into a hug. She was about five feet tall and extremely wide, carrying about three hundred pounds under a surprisingly well-tailored pink pantsuit.<br><br>She drew back and gazed at him approvingly, her over-inflated face taut and shiny. Lime green eyeshade and bright red rouge added to the beach ball effect.<br><br>"Aunt Rhonda," he said, smiling. She wasn't his aunt, but everyone in town called her that. He was surprised at how happy he was to see her.<br><br>"Just look at you," she said. "You're as handsome as I remember."<br><br>Pax felt the heat in his cheeks. He wasn't handsome, not in the ways recognized by the outside world. But in Switchcreek he was a skip, one of the few children who had come through the Changes unmarked and still breathing.<br><br>Rhonda didn't seem to notice his embarrassment. "This is a terrible thing, isn't it? People say the word 'tragic' too much, but that's what it is. I can't imagine how tough it must be on her girls."<br><br>He didn't know what to say except, "Yes."</p><h2>The Mary Frances housekeeper, or, Adventures among the doll people</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

And if someone like me can become rich, then so can you - no matter what your present circumstances. Here is how I did it and what I learned along the way&#39; Felix Dennis believes that almost anyone of reasonable intelligence can become rich, given sufficient motivation and application. How To Get Rich is a distillation of his business wisdom. Primarily concerned with the step-by-step creation of wealth, How To Get Rich ruthlessly dissects the business failures and financial triumphs of &#39;a South London lad who became rich virtually by accident&#39;. Part manual, part memoir, part primer, this book is a template for those who are willing to stare down failure and transform their lives. Canny, infuriating, cynical and generous by turns, How To Get Rich is an invaluable guide to &#39;the surprisingly simple art of collecting money which already has your name on it.</p><p>Felix Dennis was imprisoned in 1971 as co-editor of OZ magazine. After his acquittal on appeal, he founded his own magazine publishing company in 1973 and made millions with the sale of Personal Computer World and MacUser in the mid-eighties. Today, Dennis Publishing remains a privately owned company with headquarters in London and New York City. Titles include The Week, Auto Express, Computer Shopper and Maxim. The annual Sunday Times Rich List estimates that Felix Dennis is the 65th richest individual in the UK. Following a life-threatening illness, his first collection of poetry, A Glass Half Full was published by Hutchinson and the second, Lone Wolf, in 2004. His third collection, When Jack Sued Jill, will be published by Ebury Press in November 2006. His other interests include planting trees and he divides his time between homes in Warwickshire, London, New York, Connecticut and the Caribbean island of Mustique.This is not your usual get-rich-quick manual. Though Dennis, a poet (<i>When Jack Sued Jill: Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times</i>) and the founder of a publishing empire (including <i>Maxim</i> magazine), wants to help the reader rank at least among the lesser rich (equal to a net worth of $30 million&#x2013;$80 million by his definition), he isn't himself motivated by money. With his own fortune estimated at between $400 million and $900 million, he doesn't have to be. Instead, Dennis wants to demystify the money-getting process, and his straight-talking, honest advice makes a refreshing change in this oversaturated field. Using humorous examples from his own business life, Dennis's advice, from The Five Most Common Start-Up Errors to The Power of Focus, might sound like conventional fare, but delivered in his signature bawdy, British style, it's altogether more entertaining&#x2014;and more practical. Dennis highlights the right strategies and mindset to get readers their millions, but he won't air-brush his story or soften the bitter truth along the way. As he says, when it comes to acquiring wealth, being a bit of a shit helps. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I've lost and rediscovered that confidence a few times, which is a long and messy story worth simplifying and boiling down to manageable length in these first chapters. I know my original attraction to Jesus came as a young child. In my home and at Sunday school, I heard stories about Jesus. I remember a children's picture Bible that had a simple but beautiful picture of Jesus, seated, in a blue and white robe, with children of all races gathered around his knees. Some were leaning on him. Some were seated at his feet. Some had their arms around him. His arms were opened in an embrace that took them all in, and his bearded face carried a gentle smile a boy could trust. Looking back, I realize the illustration wasn't historically accurate. It was influenced more by a popular Sunday school song that I also loved ('red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world') than by ancient Middle Eastern realities. But in a way the picture was even truer than a historically accurate picture would have been; it probably would have had no red, yellow, black, or white children at all, but only brown Middle Eastern ones. The picture Bible was augmented in my imagination by flannel graph stories about Jesus. Flannel graph was a kind of 1950s high-tech precursor of overhead projectors, laptop video projectors, videos, and DVDs. The teachers were always kind women, sometimes even my own mother. Each would tell stories with an easel behind her. On the easel would be a piece of flannel cloth with a scene drawn on it with markers---a countryside, a storm at sea, a courtyard with marble columns, a home, a roadside with big boulders beside it. As the story unfolded, cut-out figures backed with felt would be stuck on the flannel background (felt and flannel being a gentle precursor of Velcro)---blind Bartimaeus, Zacchaeus, a woman near a well, a nameless leper and his nine friends, a Roman centurion, or a Syrophonecian woman with a sick child. Through these stories, Jesus won my heart. When I reached my teenage years, though, I lost that Jesus as one loses a friend in a crushing, noisy, rushing crowd. The crowd included arguments about evolution (which seemed elegant, patient, logical, and actually quite wonderful to me, more wonderful even than a literal six-day creation blitz), arguments about the Vietnam War (which made no sense to me---even if communism was as bad as everyone said, were people better off bombed and napalmed to death?), arguments about ethical issues like civil rights and desegregation and a hundred other things. I wondered if women were really supposed to be submissive to men and if rock 'n' roll was really of the devil. Were Catholics really going to burn in hell forever unless they revised their beliefs and practices to be biblical like us? After a short foray into doubt and a rather mild (all things considered) youthful rebellion, my faith in Jesus was revitalized, largely through the Jesus Movement. For those who were part of it, especially in its early days, the Jesus Movement was a truly wonderful thing. There was a simplicity, a childlikeness, a naivete, and a corresponding purity of motive that I have seldom seen since. In fact, this book may simply be an attempt to articulate what many of us felt and 'knew' during those years. But all too soon the Jesus Movement was co-opted. It was to a different Jesus that I was gradually converted.14 The first new Jesus I met had a different face, a different tone, a different function. 'Jesus was born to die,' I was told again and again, which meant his entire life---including the red, yellow, black, and white children around his knees...Zacchaeus in the sycamore tree (which gave me a lifelong love for sycamores)... Bartimaeus by the road...the one grateful leper returning...the woman by the well...the caring parents who begged him to heal their children---was quite marginalized. Everything between his birth and death was icing at most, assuredly not cake. This marginalization was unintentional, but in my experience it was very real. I was losing something but gaining something, too: the conservative Protestant (or Evangelical) Jesus. The Conservative Protestant Jesus For conservative Protestants, the Good News centers on the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus saves us by dying on the cross. 'Jesus was born to die,' I heard again and again. By dying, Jesus mysteriously absorbs the penalty of all human wrongdoing through all of history. The cross becomes the focal point where human injustice---past, present, and future---meets the unconquerable compassion and forgiveness of God. Jesus, hanging in agony, says, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' We are given confidence that at our worst moment, the moment at which we humans behave as badly as is possible in this universe by torturing and killing God's ultimate messenger and representative to us, his prayer is answered. His innocent self-sacrifice somehow cancels out human guilt. At the cross, the powerful horror of human evil and the more powerful glory of God's mercy meet, and human evil is exhausted, but not God's mercy. Exactly how this happens is understood through various metaphors, with the following four perhaps being most popular. A legal metaphor: God is judge and humanity is guilty, deserving the death penalty. Jesus, a perfect representative of humanity, willingly takes the death penalty deserved by all humanity. Justice is satisfied, and evildoers can be forgiven. In this metaphor the forensic language of law, guilt, punishment, penalty, and justification is all-important.

The husband and wife team of Julia and Derek Parker reissued this edition that offers many new components, such as the recently discovered comet/asteroid Chiron and its eccentric orbit. (For example, when Chiron is in Aries, the typical Arian could experience considerable restlessness.) It also includes new discussions on eclipses, Relocation Astrology, and Horary Astrology (which focuses on where and when a question is asked, rather than a birth chart). The first half offers rich color graphics and compelling narratives about the 12 sun signs, various chart reading techniques, and how astrology influences sexuality, health, business, and family. The second half delves into the nitty-gritty work of astrology and is downscaled to three-color visuals. It includes a hefty 150- page section on "The Planets at Work" and a 75-page section on astrological tables. The 1994 edition was faulted for being too difficult to build a chart from.

By decree, foreigners and ideas from outside Japan were forbidden. So when fourteen-year-old Manjiro and four other fishermen were shipwrecked on a small rocky island three hundred miles from shore, they wondered if they would ever be allowed to return home!</p><p>Celebrated author Rhoda Blumberg regales us with Manjiro's exciting true story. He was the first Japanese person to come to the United States, and his impressions of the country give us vivid glimpses of midnineteenth-century American life. He even took part in the Gold Rush!</p><p>In a surprising twist of fate, Manjiro became a hero in Japan, playing an important role in opening his country to westerners.</p><p>Told here by a brilliant storyteller with a passion for history, Manjiro's biography is a fast-paced, historically accurate, inspiring true-life adventure.</p></p><p><p> Rhoda Blumberg has written about the opening of Japan (1853-1854) in Commodore Perry in the <i>Land of the Shogun,</i> a Newbery Honor Book, which also won the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award and the Golden Kite Award. Her acclaimed histories also include <i>The Incredible Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, The Great American Gold Rush,</i> and <i>The Remarkable Voyages of Captain Cook,</i> all ALA Notable Books. She is the winner of the <i>Washington Post/</i>Children's Book Guild Award for her overall contribution to nonfiction. </p> <p> Rhoda Blumberg says that while doing research for <i>Commodore Perry,</i> "I read about the ordeals and strange adventures of Manjiro, then spent years replaying his life story in my mind until I felt impelled to write about him." </p> <p> The author and her husband, Gerald, live in Yorktown Heights, New York. </p>Gr. 5-9. Blumberg learned about Manjiro, the first Japanese person to live in the U.S., when she wrote the Newbery Honor Book <i>Commodore Perry in the Land of Shogun </i>(1985). Now she devotes an entire volume to his remarkable life, beginning with his childhood as a fatherless boy working as a fisherman to support his family. A shipwreck strands Manjiro on an island, where he is rescued by a passing whaling ship. He works with the crew, learning the particulars of whaling, and eventually becomes a surrogate son to the ship's captain, who takes Manjiro back to Massachusetts and to an education. After another stint at sea, Manjiro joins the gold rush and makes enough money to return to Japan. He avoids imprisonment and even death (the xenophobic era's sentence for Japanese who returned from foreign countries) by instructing the country's top officials about American customs and policies. He eventually becomes a samurai, helping broker the opening of Japanese ports to the rest of the world. Exemplary in both her research and writing, Blumberg hooks readers with anecdotes that astonish without sensationalizing, and she uses language that's elegant and challenging, yet always clear. Particularly notable is the well-chosen reproductions of original artwork, including some sketches by Manjiro himself, which help illustrate Japanese culture and viewpoints of the time, the whaling industry, and nineteenth-century America. An author's note, bibliography, and suggested Web sites conclude this outstanding biography. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Virginia Thorndike tells us how to identify all the individual vessels and gives the histories and vital statistics for each. This is an essential guide for anyone interested in taking a windjammer cruise, for boaters cruising the coast of Maine who want to identify windjammers they see, and for armchair sailors who enjoy reading about these traditional sailing vessels, most of which began their careers as cargo carriers, pilot boats, fishermen, and private yachts.</p><p>Virginia Thorndike has written several books about boats and transportation. She enjoys spending as much time on the water as possible, photographing the vessels she sees and later researching their histories. Sailing is in her blood: Her great-grandfather was three times the America&#x2019;s Cup defender, and her grandfather was a designer of sailing yachts and also an America&#x2019;s Cup contender. Virginia lives in Morrill, Maine.The vessels in the windjammer fleet today range in age from more than 130 years to less than a decade. The older craft have worked in various capacities all along the Atlantic coast. Some were built as coasting schooners, performing the service that trucks fulfill today, carrying raw material, produce, and supplies from one coastal community to another. Others made ocean passages carrying freight. Some fished for swordfish on the Grand Bands, or for cod and mackerel, or for oysters on Delaware Bay. A couple served as pilot boats, delivering pilots to guide ships into New England ports. A few were originally built as private yachts. The Bowdoin was built for scientific exploration and education; although she is not now part of the windjammer fleet, she was once, and continues to make her home in Penobscot Bay.</p><h2>Higher Gossip: Essays and Criticism</h2><p>A collection both intimate and generous of the eloquent, insightful, beautifully written prose works that John Updike was compiling when he died in January 2009.<br><br>This collection of miscellaneous prose opens with a self-portrait of the writer in winter, a Prospero who, though he fears his most dazzling performances are behind him, reveals himself in every sentence to be in deep conversation with the sources of his magic. It concludes with a moving meditation on a modern world robbed of imagination--a world without religion, without art--and on the difficulties of faith in a disbelieving age. In between are previously uncollected stories and poems, a pageant of scenes from seventeenth-century Massachusetts, five late "golf dreams," and several of Updike's commentaries on his own work. At the heart of the book are his matchless reviews--of John Cheever, Ann Patchett, Toni Morrison, William Maxwell, John le Carr�, and essays on Aimee Semple McPherson, Max Factor, and Albert Einstein, among others. Also included are two decades of art criticism--on Chardin, El Greco, Blake, Turner, Van Gogh, Max Ernest, and more.<br><br>Updike's criticism is gossip of the highest order, delivered in an intimate and generous voice.</p><p><b>John Updike</b> was the author of more than sixty books, including collections of short stories, poems, and criticism. His novels have been honored with the Pulitzer Prize (twice), the National Book Award, and the Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. <i>Hugging the Shore</i>, an earlier collection of essays and reviews, received the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism. He died in January 2009.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Christopher Carduff</b>, the editor of this volume, is a member of the staff of The Library of America.THE WRITER IN WINTER<br><br>Young or old, a writer sends a book into the world, not himself. There is no Senior Tour for authors, with the tees shortened by twenty yards and carts allowed. No mercy is extended by the reviewers; but, then, it is not extended to the rookie writer, either. He or she may feel, as the gray-haired scribes of the day continue to take up space and consume the oxygen in the increasingly small room of the print world, that the elderly have the edge, with their established names and already secured honors. How we did adore and envy them, the idols of our college years-Hemingway and Faulkner, Frost and Eliot, Mary McCarthy and Flannery O'Connor and Eudora Welty! We imagined them aswim in a heavenly refulgence, as joyful and immutable in their exalted condition as angels forever singing.<br><br>Now that I am their age-indeed, older than a number of them got to be- I can appreciate the advantages, for a writer, of youth and obscurity. You are not yet typecast. You can take a distant, cold view of the entire literary scene. You are full of your material-your family, your friends, your region of the country, your generation-when it is fresh and seems urgently worth communicating to readers. No amount of learned skills can substitute for the feeling of having a lot to say, of bringing news. Memories, impressions, and emotions from your first twenty years on earth are most writers' main material; little that comes afterward is quite so rich and resonant. By the age of forty, you have probably mined the purest veins of this precious lode; after that, continued creativity is a matter of sifting the leavings. You become playful and theoretical; you invent sequels, and attempt historical novels. The novels and stories thus generated may be more polished, more ingenious, even more humane than their predecessors; but none does quite the essential earthmoving work that Hawthorne, a writer who dwelt in the shadowland "where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet," specified when he praised the novels of Anthony Trollope as being "as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case."<br><br>This second quotation-one writer admiring a virtue he couldn't claim- meant a lot to me when I first met it, and I have cited it before. A few images, a few memorable acquaintances, a few cherished phrases circle around the aging writer's head like gnats as he strolls through the summertime woods at gloaming. He sits down before the word processor's humming, expectant screen, facing the strong possibility that he has already expressed what he is struggling to express again.<br><br>My word processor-a term that describes me as well-is the last of a series of instruments of self-expression that began with crayons and colored pencils held in my childish fist. My hands, somewhat grown, migrated to the keyboard of my mother's typewriter, a portable Remington, and then, schooled in touch-typing, to my own machine, a beige Smith Corona expressly bought by loving parents for me to take to college. I graduated to an office model, on the premises of The New Yorker, that rose up, with an exciting heave, from the surface of a metal desk. Back in New England as a free-lancer, I invested in an electric typewriter that snatched the letters from my fingertips with a sharp, premature clack; it held, as well as a black ribbon, a white one with which I could correct my many errors. Before long, this clever mechanism gave way to an even more highly evolved device, an early Wang word processor that did the typing itself, with a marvellous speed and infallibility. My next machine, an IBM, made the Wang seem slow and clunky and has been in turn superseded by a Dell that deals in dozens of type fonts and has a built-in spell checker. Through all this relentlessly advancing technology the same brain gropes through its diminishing neurons for images and narratives that will lift lumps out of the earth and put them under the glass case of published print.<br><br>With ominous frequency, I can't think of the right word. I know there is a word; I can visualize the exact shape it occupies in the jigsaw puzzle of the English language. But the word itself, with its precise edges and unique tint of meaning, hangs on the misty rim of consciousness. Eventually, with shamefaced recourse to my well-thumbed thesaurus or to a germane encyclopedia article, I may pin the word down, only to discover that it unfortunately rhymes with the adjoining word of the sentence. Meanwhile, I have lost the rhythm and syntax of the thought I was shaping up, and the paragraph has skidded off (like this one) in an unforeseen direction.<br><br>When, against my better judgment, I glance back at my prose from twenty or thirty years ago, the quality I admire and fear to have lost is its carefree bounce, its snap, its exuberant air of slight excess. The author, in his boyish innocence, is calling, like the sorcerer's apprentice, upon unseen powers-the prodigious potential of this flexible language's vast vocabulary. Prose should have a flow, the forward momentum of a certain energized weight; it should feel like a voice tumbling into your ear.<br><br>An aging writer wonders if he has lost the ability to visualize a completed work, in its complex spatial relations. He should have in hand a provocative beginning and an ending that will feel inevitable. Instead, he may arrive at his ending nonplussed, the arc of his intended tale lying behind him in fragments. The threads have failed to knit. The leap of faith with which every narrative begins has landed him not on a far safe shore but in the middle of the drink. The failure to make final sense is more noticeable in a writer like Agatha Christie, whose last mysteries don't quite solve all their puzzles, than in a broad-purposed visionary like Iris Murdoch, for whom puzzlement is part of the human condition. But in even the most sprawling narrative, things must add up.<br><br>The ability to fill in a design is almost athletic, requiring endurance and agility and drawing upon some of the same mental muscles that develop early in mathematicians and musicians. Though writing, being partly a function of experience, has few truly precocious practitioners, early success and burnout are a dismally familiar American pattern. The mental muscles slacken, that first freshness fades. In my own experience, diligent as I have been, the early works remain the ones I am best known by, and the ones to which my later works are unfavorably compared. Among the rivals besetting an aging writer is his younger, nimbler self, when he was the cocky new thing.<br><br>From the middle of my teens I submitted drawings, poems, and stories to The New Yorker; all came back with the same elegantly terse printed rejection slip. My first break came late in my college career, when a short story that I had based on my grandmother's slow dying of Parkinson's disease was returned with a note scrawled in pencil at the bottom of the rejection slip. It read, if my failing memory serves: "Look-we don't use stories of senility, but try us again."<br><br>Now "stories of senility" are about the only ones I have to tell. My only new experience is of aging, and not even the aged much want to read about it. We want to read, judging from the fiction that is printed, about life in full tide, in love or at war-bulletins from the active battlefields, the wretched childhoods, the poignant courtships, the fraught adulteries, the big deals, the scandals, the crises of sexually and professionally active adults. My first published novel was about old people; my hero was a ninety-year-old man. Having lived as a child with aging grandparents, I imagined old age with more vigor, color, and curiosity than I could bring to a description of it now.<br><br>I don't mean to complain. Old age treats free-lance writers pretty gently. There is no compulsory retirement at the office, and no athletic injuries signal that the game is over for good. Even with modern conditioning, a ballplayer can't stretch his career much past forty, and at the same age an actress must yield the romantic lead to a younger woman. A writer's fan base, unlike that of a rock star, is post-adolescent, and relatively tolerant of time's scars; it distressed me to read of some teen-ager who, subjected to the Rolling Stones' halftime entertainment at a recent Super Bowl, wondered why that skinny old man (Mick Jagger) kept taking his shirt off and jumping around. The literary critics who coped with Hemingway's later, bare-chested novel Across the River and Into the Trees asked much the same thing.<br><br>By and large, time moves with merciful slowness in the old-fashioned world of writing. The eighty-eight-year-old Doris Lessing won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Elmore Leonard and P. D. James continue, into their eighties, to produce best-selling thrillers. Although books circulate ever more swiftly through the bookstores and back to the publisher again, the rhythms of readers are leisurely. They spread recommendations by word of mouth and "get around" to titles and authors years after making a mental note of them. A movie has a few weeks to find its audience, and television shows flit by in an hour, but books physically endure, in public and private libraries, for generations. Buried reputations, like Melville's, resurface in academia; avant-garde worthies such as Cormac McCarthy attain, late in life, best-seller lists and The Oprah Winfrey Show.<br><br>A pervasive unpredictability lends hope to even the most superannuated competitor in the literary field. There is more than one measurement of success. A slender poetry volume selling fewer than a thousand copies and receiving a handful of admiring reviews can give its author a pride and sense of achievement denied more mercenary producers of the written word. As for bad reviews and poor sales, they can be dismissed on the irrefutable hypothesis that reviewers and book buyers are too obtuse to appreciate true excellence. Over time, many books quickly bloom and then vanish; a precious few unfold, petal by petal, and become classics.<br><br>An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while. The pleasures, for him, of bookmaking-the first flush of inspiration, the patient months of research and plotting, the laser-printed final draft, the back-and- forthing with Big Apple publishers, the sample pages, the jacket sketches, the proofs, and at last the boxes from the printers, with their sweet heft and smell of binding glue-remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best.<br><br>A DESERT ENCOUNTER<br><br>In our fifth winter in the Southwest, my wife discovered that her gardening skills could be turned to xerophilous plants. All afternoon, she had served as my assistant and directress in pruning some ocotillo, and was enough exhilarated by the results to turn my attention to our overgrown hedge of mixed olive and oleander. Ocotillo is a tall, wandlike candlewood with vicious thorns and a feathery orange flower at its tip; handling it, even with thick leather gloves, requires the concentration of a bomb squad.<br><br>The electric trimmer I had borrowed for the massy hedge was dull and noisy. Further, the electric socket on our porch was distant, a hundred-foot extension cord away. I had to keep crawling on my hands and knees through gaps in the hedge to take the trimmer, trailing the gnarling extension cord, to the other side. And then there was the spindly aluminum stepladder that I had to keep shifting and leaning against springy branches to gain access to the hedge's overgrown top. Our condo sits on a slant, in the foothills of a pink-and-tan mountain range, which made moving the ladder one-handed and then balancing my weight on its higher steps feel heroically precarious.<br><br>My sense of triumph when my wife and I agreed that the job had been completed was marred by a mysterious circumstance: my hat had disappeared. Repeatedly getting down on my hands and knees to search beneath the hedge and circling the stony area of caliche where I had labored, I failed to find it. At this latitude, the elderly need to shelter their heads against the intemperate desert sun, and I discovered within myself an agitating grief in regard to the disappearance of the hat, a simple, brimmed floppy affair bearing the logo of an organization of which, years ago, I had been pleased to be elected a member.<br><br>Even as the shadows were deepening in the saguaro-studded mountain clefts, and the sun was lowering over the blue range to the west, I, with the circular compulsions of an aging brain, kept wandering out of doors, convinced that one more search in and around the hedge and the ocotillo would produce my missing headgear.<br><br>A breadth of paving passes close by the hedge. There, on the slanting asphalt, part parking lot and part side road, a curious confluence arose: an ancient man, brightly dressed in white trousers and a striped, starched shirt, made his ragged way downhill with the help of a cane, while, nearby, a Roto-Rooter operative in a khaki uniform was packing up his truck at the end of his workday. Oleander roots work their way into the clay drainage pipes of our aging complex and obstruct flow.<br><br>The gentleman in white trousers greeted me as if we had often met before, though we had not. "What are you doing?" he asked, tilting his head to receive the answer.<br><br>I decided to be honest, however foolish it made me seem. "I'm looking for my hat."<br><br>The Roto-Rooter man overheard us. "Hat?" he echoed. "There's a hat over here."<br><br>By "over here" he meant the curb on the far side of the asphalt, where it had never occurred to me, in all my peering around and under the hedge, to cast a glance. The hat must have fallen from my head in the course of my awkward, preoccupying struggles, and the desert breeze that springs up in the late afternoon had moved it twenty feet away.<br><br>"My hat!" I exclaimed. "It is!" I hurried over and, as if to prove my ownership to my two new companions, put it on my head. "Thank you, thank you," I said to each.<br><br>The man in khaki smiled, his share of my pleasure appropriately moderate, as he coiled his rooter and distributed the last of his tools to their places in the back of his truck. The older man, however, bent and bowlegged as he was, made my happiness his own. Quizzically beaming, he came closer to me, the shadow of his cane elongating to the east, where the last golfers at the local country club, calling to one another like birds at dawn, were finishing their rounds before darkness fell. "What does it say on your hat?" he asked me.</p><h2>What Do You Mean the Third Dimension is Going Away? Why Now is the Time to Release Who You Are Not and Remember Who You Are</h2><p>There is a change underway, a Shift that is not only altering our consciousness, it is affecting every aspect of life on the planet; our political, social and economic structures, the environment, the weather, every institution, all the wars, how we view our relationships, our work, every thought we think, and every feeling we feel. In simple terms, the old habits of thinking, feeling, and behaving that we know as the third dimension are going away. We are all shifting into a fourth, and then into a fifth dimensional consciousness and experience. <p> As exciting as this transition is, it is also creating difficulties for many who are suddenly experiencing feelings, situations, and emotions for which they have no frame of reference. </p><p> But with some basic information about what the Shift is and some simple energy tools to help manage our thoughts and feelings, we all have the ability to evolve our consciousness, release our mental and emotional baggage, and move gracefully and joyfully into these higher vibrational realms. </p><p> This book explains what the Shift is all about, why it's happening now, and how it's affecting all of us. It also explains what the third, fourth, and fifth dimensions are, and why they are the most important considerations of your life right now. Most importantly, it provides you with some simple yet profound energy tools that have helped thousands of people move fluidly through the unprecedented changes of this Shift without fear, without effort, without the tension and anxiety that has been, for the most part, the daily habit of our lives. </p><p> The third dimension is going away. But we are at the beginning of a new way of life, not the end. Each of us must awaken now. Each must make the shift within. </p><p> It's time to release who you are not and remember who you really are.</p><p><b>Includes many URLs and QR Codes linked to audio-lectures and energy work on the Mastering Alchemy site.</b></p></p><p>Jim Self is an international teacher, speaker, author, and leader in the field of spiritual development. <p> One of the few teachers, authors and speakers actually working at the leading edge, providing solid, up-to-date information and practical energy tools to help us keep pace with the Shift, Jim walks with a foot in both worlds. </p><p> At the age of twenty-six, Jim was elected to his first of two terms to the San Jose, CA City Council and later became the Vice Mayor.

It was the quiet beginning to the most resonant baseball achievement of all time. Starting that day, the vaunted Yankee centerfielder kept on hitting-at least one hit in game after game after game.<br><br>In the summer of 1941, as Nazi forces moved relentlessly across Europe and young American men were drafted by the millions, it seemed only a matter of time before the U.S. went to war. The nation was apprehensive. Yet for two months in that tense summer, America was captivated by DiMaggio's astonishing hitting streak. In 56, Kostya Kennedy tells the remarkable story of how the streak found its way into countless lives, from the Italian kitchens of Newark to the playgrounds of Queens to the San Francisco streets of North Beach; from the Oval Office of FDR to the Upper West Side apartment where Joe's first wife, Dorothy, the movie starlet, was expecting a child. In this crisp, evocative narrative Joe DiMaggio emerges in a previously unseen light, a 26-year-old on the cusp of becoming an icon. He comes alive-a driven ballplayer, a mercurial star and a conflicted husband-as the tension and the scrutiny upon him build with each passing day.<br><br>DiMaggio's achievement lives on as the greatest of sports records. Alongside the story of DiMaggio's dramatic quest, Kennedy deftly examines the peculiar nature of hitting streaks and with an incisive, modern-day perspective gets inside the number itself, as its sheer improbability heightens both the math and the magic of 56 games in a row.</p><p><b>Kostya Kennedy</b> is an assistant managing editor at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>56: Joe DiMaggio and the Last Magic Number in Sports</i>, winner of the 2011 Casey Award and runner-up for the 2012 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing.

By the author of <i>The Gulf.</i> National ad/promo.</p><p><b>David Poyer </b>graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, and served on destroyers and amphibious ships. He transferred to reserve commission in 1977 and began writing. His other novels of the U.S. Navy, <i>The Med, The Gulf, </i>and <i>The Passage, </i>also feature Dan Lenson. He recently was the Distinguished Visiting Author at the U.S. Naval Academy. Poyer lives with his wife and daughter on Virginia's Eastern Shore.<br>The first cruise of a newly commissioned Annapolis graduate takes him to the brink of war in the Arctic--in another realistic naval adventure by the author of The Med (1988) and The Gulf (1990). Reporting for the first assignment of his career, Ensign Dan Lenson steps onto the unmanned quarterdeck of USS Ryan and learns within seconds that he's on a troubled command. Built to last the duration of WW II, the destroyer has instead sailed into the mid- 1970's, and it's worn out. Assigned by the Ryan's corrupt executive officer to serve as first lieutenant, Lenson is responsible for the seaworthiness of all topside spaces. His crew of boatswain mates ranges from the criminal to the subnormally intelligent. But even if they were thoroughly competent, there aren't enough of them to effect the repairs left undone when the ship was yanked early from dry-dock overhaul. It's in this state that USS Ryan sets out for duty above the Arctic Circle, where the ship is to test experimental sonar gear. The duty is very nearly the death of the craft. Storms, ice, and a renegade Soviet nuclear submarine combine to test the limits of the ship and crew. The executive officer, drug-dealing sailors, and the relentless grind of duty also test the limits of Dan Lenson. When at last the Ryan is freed from Arctic duty, the exhausted crew is sent to operate with a fast carrier attack force west of Ireland, and there Ryan's luck runs out. The upshot of a horrifying tragedy at sea is a cold examination of the essence of naval command. A first-rate naval adventure. Poyer's depictions of the contemporary American Navy continue to be unequalled for authenticity. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With a mission to eliminate the enemy, he also thinks about the survival of his men. He believes his cause is just to fight for the freedom of his Vietnamese allies. Yet, he and his comrades are seduced by the savage mentality of combat. It is a daily life-or-death proposition, one that seeps into the darkest corners of a Marine's soul and penetrates the very core of his being, saturating the mind, body, and spirit of man. <p>Donald F. Myers' "Your War,My War- A Marine in Vietnam" transports its readers into the ever present chaos and hysteria of active combat in the Vietnam War. His chronicle begins October 30,1967, Gio Linh, and spans sixteen months, following him through the drudgeries of military life. Each chapter represents a day's journal entry, juxtaposed with American newspapers that coincide with the entries, allowing the reader to envision the contrast of the American political and journalistic structure versus a day at battle, the reality of Vietnam. </p><p>"Your War, My War" is the "Red Badge of Courage of the Vietnam War," says MGySgt Peter deConnick, USMC Ret.

A few days before the first Christmas of that long bloodletting then called the Great War, hundreds of thousands of cold, trench-bound combatants put aside their arms and, in defiance of their orders, tacitly agreed to stop the killing in honor of the holiday.<p> That informal truce began with small acts: here opposing Scottish and German troops would toss newspapers, ration tins, and friendly remarks across the lines; there ambulance parties, clearing the dead from the barbwire hell of no man's land, would stop to share cigarettes and handshakes. Soon it spread, so that by Christmas Eve the armies of France, England, and Germany were serenading each other with Christmas carols and sentimental ballads and denouncing the conflict with cries of <i>"� bas la guerre!"</i> and <i>"Nie wieder Krieg!"</i> The truce was, writes Stanley Weintraub, a remarkable episode, and, though "dismissed in official histories as an aberration of no consequence," it was so compelling that many who observed it wrote in near-disbelief to their families and hometown newspapers to report the extraordinary event.</p><p> In the end, writes Weintraub, the truce ended with a few stray bullets that escalated into total war, and that would fill the air for just shy of four more Christmases to come; further, isolated attempts at informal peacemaking would fail. But what, Weintraub wonders at the close of this inspired study, would have happened if the soldiers on both sides had refused to take up arms again? His counterfactual scenarios are intriguing, and well worth pondering. <i>-- Gregory McNamee</i></p>Stanley Weintraub is Professor of Arts and Humanities at Pennsylvania State University and writes as a book critic for the NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL and WASHINGTON POST.</p><h2>The Nine Wrong Answers</h2><p>The story of a baffling murder takes place in London and at the BBC studios and the home of Sherlock Holmes</p><p></p><h2>World History, Culture, &amp; Geography The Modern World California</h2><p>2019 [Impact California Social Studies] World History, Culture, &amp; Geography: The Modern World (CA)(H) by Jackson J.

Mosquito is where African-American literature is heading as we approach the twenty-first century.--E. Ethelbert Miller, <i>Emerge</i></p><p>Depending on your tolerance for digression, Gayl Jones's <i>Mosquito</i> will either be hugely entertaining or absolutely crazy-making. The heroine and narrator of this hefty tome is Sojourner Jane Nadine Johnson--Mosquito, to her friends--an African American truck driver with a mind as flighty as the insect she's named for. You know what you're up against from the very first paragraph in which Mosquito expounds on Texas border towns, tanning products, cacti, a teacup shaped like a cactus, the town of Brownsville, and the Kiowa word for Brownsville (which she can't remember). All of this is delivered in lively dialect: "Am got a few of them cactus plants along Dairy Mart Road, though they ain't the archetypal cactus. I think it's Dairy Mart Road and some of that poverty grass. I guess it called poverty grass 'cause it the Southwest, you know. I'm going to have to find out the names of these grasses and plants and trees so's I can tell y'all what they is. I guess that's what I likes about the Southwest, though, the landscape. Well, I likes the people that I likes (the Perfectability Baptist Church would want me to say more about the likability of peoples and us commandments to love), but when you gets to the Southwest it got it own distinctive landscape." And obviously Sojourner Jane Nadine Johnson, a.k.a. Mosquito, has her own distinctive personality. <p> What sets the story rolling is Mosquito's discovery of a young pregnant Mexican woman in the back of her truck. Not surprisingly, it takes all of chapter 1 for her to actually <i>get</i> to this discovery as she is distracted numerous times by her mail, other people she's met along the road, a trip to an aquarium in Florida, and the relationship between yoga and yogurt--to name just a few of the many, <i>many</i> subjects she expounds upon before finally getting back around to the pregnant Mexican in the truck. From here on out, the novel concerns Mosquito's involvement in a "new underground railroad," a sanctuary movement for illegal immigrants. In addition to mother-to-be Maria, we meet Delgadina, a Chicana bartender and wannabe detective; Monkey Bread, a childhood friend; and Ray, a man Mosquito might just be willing to slow down for. What raises this novel above the merely picaresque is Jones's sophisticated political sensibility: as Mosquito makes her physical journey across the Southwest, she embarks on a cultural odyssey as well, examining the struggles of all the "second class peoples" to find a place for themselves in America. Letters, plays, poetry, and songs punctuate the narrative and Mosquito's distinctive voice always keeps the story "keepin' on." <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Gayl Jones was born in Kentucky in 1949.

Through my Web site, www.jorgecruise.com, I've had the honor of helping more than 3 million clients shed stubborn fat, end emotional eating, and take those first confident steps into new lives--lives that are full of possibility. I understand the struggle to lose weight and keep it off. I've been there. I struggled with weight as a child and young man. I come from an overweight family. We struggled to slim down and shape up. It is that struggle that led me to my life's work.<br><br>That's why I'm so excited for you. You are about to start a transformation that will revolutionize your life and your belly.<br><br>the 8 minute revolution<br><br>Now for the big question that you've probably been wondering since you picked up this book. How will you lose up to 6 inches in less than 4 weeks in just 8 minutes a day?<br><br>To understand the answer to that question, I must first let you in on a secret. You see, there's a revolution going on the field of weight loss. Cardiovascular exercise (otherwise known as aerobics) and dieting are out. Resistance training is in. Experts now agree that you must create lean muscle tissue in order to shed fat anywhere in your body, and particularly in your abdomen. Lean muscle provides the key that opens the lock on even the most sluggish of metabolisms. Rev up your metabolism and you will burn calories all day long, incinerating the fat in your abdomen that's hiding your beautiful belly muscles.<br><br>That's why all of my 8 Minutes in the Morning programs focus on building lean muscle tissue. You must exercise aerobically for a half-hour or more to burn the same number of calories as the 24/7 metabolism boost that you get from just 8 daily minutes of resistance training. If you've avoided exercise because you thought you didn't have time to work out, I'm happy to tell you that 8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly changes the rules. In just 8 minutes each day, you will create the muscle needed to rev up your metabolism and incinerate the fat in your abdomen. No other weight- loss program provides such a big return on such a small investment. Take the 8-minute challenge. It's well worth the time!<br><br>tested by people just like you<br><br>Are you still wondering how I can promise you such extraordinary results in just 8 minutes a day?<br><br>Here's a little more background on how I created this exciting program. As I said earlier, through my JorgeCruise.com online club, I have the privilege of working with 3 million online clients. And my online clients don't have time to waste. They are very busy people with full schedules. They want to lose weight in the most efficient and simple manner possible. Thus, "Weight Loss for Busy People" has become what the Jorge Cruise brand is all about. I am 100 percent dedicated to helping time-challenged people lose weight and keep it off. That's my specialty.<br><br>And those very same clients helped me create and test the 8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly program. You see, after the success of my New York Times best-selling book 8 Minutes in the Morning and my newest book, 8 Minutes in the Morning for Real Shapes, Real Sizes, more than 1 million new clients logged onto JorgeCruise.com and shared with me how they lost weight with my first two programs. They told me stories about how my first book, 8 Minutes in the Morning, helped them lose 15 to 20 �ds or how they shed a stunning 30 or more �ds with my second book, 8 Minutes in the Morning for Real Shapes, Real Sizes.<br><br>But many of them wanted more. They asked me to help them target specific trouble zones. And one of the most requested areas was the belly.<br><br>your "8 minute" edge<br><br>In just 8 minutes each morning, you will:<br><br>. Firm and tone your belly muscles . Burn the fat that's hiding your beautiful belly . Lose up to 2 �ds of fat a week . Shrink your waistline . Improve your health . Boost your confidence<br><br>Well, I knew what I had to do. I designed an 8-minute program that specifically targets the belly, and I tested it on my online clients over and over until I was completely confident that it would help everyone shed belly fat in just 8 minutes a day. This program builds on the success of my two other books. It takes the weight-loss formula that I've tested again and again on millions of clients and applies it specifically to the belly area. I'm happy to tell you that anyone can use this supplementary program to beautify the belly--in just 8 minutes a day!<br><br>It doesn't matter whether you've lost weight with one of my other books or whether this is your first experience with a Jorge Cruise program. Either way, you will experience fantastic results. If you haven't read my other books, that's okay. Everything you need to lose weight and firm up your belly is right here within the pages of this book.<br><br>abdominal fat's dirty little secret<br><br>Before you embark on my exciting 8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly program, let's first take a look at why you want to create a beautiful belly. Many people want to tone their bellies for visual reasons. Not a day goes by that one of my clients doesn't ask me how she can look better in a swimsuit. Some tell me that they desperately want to zip up a particular pair of jeans. Or they just want to be able to look down and not see a bulge!<br><br>Those are all good reasons. But there are a few crucial and even more important reasons to start my 8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly program.<br><br>Here's the real bad news about abdominal fat. Belly fat is worse for your health than fat in your butt or thighs. Yes, belly fat tends to trigger your liver to release its stored fatty acids--raising your cholesterol levels. It also tends to alter levels of key hormones involved in appetite, fat storage, and heart disease. In fact, when you gain weight in your abdomen, and these hormones become altered, you tend to feel hungrier, you eat more, and your body tends to store more fat in your abdomen. It's a vicious cycle--but you can break it!<br><br>robert sutherlin jr. shrunk 4 inches from his belly!<br><br>"Jorge's program is so easy to do and definitely targets the belly area. When I concentrate on keeping the muscles tight during the exercise, it is easy to get the 'burn' quickly, which, to me, means that I'm doing them correctly!<br><br>"To keep my eating in check, I do a lot of self-talk. Where once I would have simply turned to the fridge when I was feeling down, bored, or lonely, I now ask myself if I really want whatever it is I am planning to eat. I catch myself just looking through the fridge and I say to myself, 'Why are you eating? You're not hungry, so either get busy or go to bed.' It often helps me just close the fridge door and walk away."<br><br>Robert lost 19 �ds of belly fat.<br><br>Before we talk about how you will break your belly fat cycle, let's first take a look at all of the ways it erodes your health.<br><br>Diabetes. Research shows that women with a waist circumference of 36 inches or more are five times more likely to develop diabetes than those with smaller waist circumferences. When you gain weight in your abdomen, the fat throws off your insulin cycle. This important hormone, produced by the pancreas, is supposed to shuttle blood sugar into muscle cells so that those cells can burn it for energy. However, in people who have a lot of abdominal fat, insulin stops working properly. The muscle cells fail to respond to insulin and sugar remains high in the blood. This makes the pancreas release more and more insulin, which can eventually wear out your pancreas and develop into diabetes. At the same time, high levels of insulin trigger you to eat by making you feel hungry. They also encourage your liver to convert your blood sugar into fat--for storage! High insulin levels have also been linked with certain cancers.<br><br>Heart disease. In Harvard's famed Nurse's Health Study of 4,470 women, those with a waist circumference of 32 inches or more were twice as likely to suffer a heart attack as those with smaller waists. Just as belly fat causes diabetes, it also raises blood cholesterol levels, contributing to heart disease. As your liver converts more and more blood sugar into fat, your cholesterol levels go up as this fat must make its way through your blood stream and into waiting fat cells--usually in your belly! In particular, the unhealthy LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels rise, whereas the healthy HDL cholesterol takes a nosedive. Belly fat raises your risk for high blood cholesterol by 50 percent.<br><br>Breast cancer. The more body fat you have--particularly in your abdomen-- the higher your estrogen levels. Body fat produces its own estrogen, in addition to the estrogen produced by your ovaries. Usually, this doesn't cause problems. But when you have a large amount of body fat, you risk raising estrogen levels too high, increasing your risk for breast cancer. Also, as I've already mentioned, belly fat tends to raise insulin levels-- which also have been linked with breast cancer. Women with high levels of belly fat are 45 percent more likely to have breast cancer. Belly fat also raises your risk for endometrial cancer.<br><br>"Women with a waist circumference of 36 inches or more are five times more likely to develop diabetes."<br><br>High blood pressure. Excess belly fat raises your risk for high blood pressure by 60 percent. In fact, each �d of extra fat can raise your systolic (top) blood pressure number by 4.5 points. It does so because your heart must work harder to pump blood to a larger body. It's the same as if you added many rooms onto an existing house but kept the same furnace. The furnace would have to work overtime to heat the larger house. In this case, your heart beats faster and more forcefully. This forces blood with more pressure through your arteries, causing nicks and dents to the linings of your arteries, raising your risk for heart disease.<br><br>Back pain. Fat in your belly acts like a heavy weight that pulls your lower spine forward, overly arching your lower back and causing pain. When you lose the fat and strengthen your abdomen, your belly muscles can better support your spine, improving your posture and reducing back pain.<br><br>Fatigue. Just as your heart can't grow larger to respond to the demands of a larger body, the same goes for your lungs. They now must work harder to supply more oxygen. Also, as your belly grows larger, it crowds out your internal organs, particularly the diaphragm muscle that's so important in breathing. People with a lot of belly fat tend to cough and wheeze more. Belly fat also raises your risk for sleep apnea, a severe form of snoring in which your windpipe repeatedly collapses throughout the night, causing your body to starve for oxygen.<br><br>Varicose veins. Excess body weight makes it harder for the blood in your legs to travel against the force of gravity back up to your heart. Belly fat also weighs down the veins in your upper thighs. Both problems cause the veins to weaken. Eventually they begin to leak and even allow blood to pool and travel backward, causing varicose veins.<br><br>Joint pain. The heavier your body, the more it weighs down your joints and the more impact you inflict on your joints with every step.<br><br>In addition, belly fat has also been linked to chronic pain, gallbladder disease, arthritis, low immunity, liver disease, skin problems, and poor sleep. It's time to put an end to this vicious health-eroding cycle once and for all!<br><br>the benefits of a firm belly<br><br>Losing weight in your midsection will help you prevent all of those diseases and conditions. You'll live longer and feel better!<br><br>My special Cruise Moves (you'll learn more about them in chapter 3) will do even more. They will help strengthen the muscles in your abdomen, providing a number of exciting benefits.<br><br>Most important, stronger abdominal muscles help to automatically improve your posture. Strong abdominal muscles help support your spine, helping to keep it erect and long. They also help to hold your pelvis in the correct position, preventing the swayback so often seen after pregnancy and with increasing age. Once you eliminate that swayback, the rest of the spine tends to fall into line, allowing you to bring back your shoulders and head and stand taller and more upright.<br><br>In fact, even if you don't lose any weight, your appearance will improve dramatically. Stronger abdominal muscles will help you stand taller, creating a leaner appearance. You will feel as if you have grown an inch taller and slimmed an inch in the process-- just by improving your posture!<br><br>Beautiful Belly Basics<br><br>Here are some of the most common questions and comments I've received from my online clients about their bellies.<br><br>I've been doing 100 crunches every day for the past month and my belly is still as big as ever. What gives?<br><br>You may not be doing the most effective exercises for your belly. You need to target and isolate four important belly areas in order to create a firm belly. That means you must do four different exercises. You can experience faster, better results by doing fewer repetitions of four different exercises than you can by spending more time with just one exercise. That's why each of my belly routines includes four different Cruise Moves.<br><br>I'm convinced that my metabolism is shot. Will anything help me lose weight?<br><br>Your metabolism may indeed be slower than normal, particularly if you've dieted over and over again. (You'll find out why dieting is bad in chapter 4.) But you can give your metabolism a swift kick by building lean muscle. Each �d of lean muscle burns 50 calories a day--just to maintain itself. You'll learn more about this in chapter 3.<br><br>I started a running program but my belly is still big.

The furious Barnes responded by suing Roosevelt for an enormous sum that could have financially devastated him. The spectacle of Roosevelt defending himself in a lawsuit captured the imagination of the nation, and more than fifty newspapers sent reporters to cover the trial. Accounts from inside and outside the courtroom combined with excerpts from the trial transcript give us Roosevelt in his own words and serve as the heart of <em>Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense</em>. <br><br>This was Roosevelt&#x2019;s final fight to defend his political legacy, and perhaps regain his fading stature. He spent more than a week on the witness stand, revealing hidden secrets of the American political system, and then endured a merciless cross-examination. Witnesses including a young Franklin D. Roosevelt and a host of well-known political leaders were questioned by two of the most brilliant attorneys in the country. <br><br>Following the case through court transcripts, news reports, and other primary sources, Dan Abrams and David Fisher present a high-definition picture of the American legal system in a nation standing on the precipice of the Great War, with its former president fighting for the ideals he held dear.</p><p>Dan Abrams is the chief legal affairs anchor for ABC News and CEO and founder of Abrams Media.

Who first came up with the idea of placing snowballs on top of each other, and who decided they would use a carrot for a nose? Most puzzling of all: How can this mystery ever be solved, with all the evidence long since melted? The snowman appears everywhere on practically everything - from knickknacks to greeting cards to seasonal sweaters we plan to return. Whenever we see big snowballs our first impulse is to deck them out with a top hat. Humorist and writer Bob Eckstein has long been fascinated by this ubiquitous symbol of wintertime fun -- and finally, for the first time, one of the world&#39;s most popular icons gets his due. A thoroughly entertaining exploration, The History of the Snowman travels back in time to shed light on the snowman&#39;s enigmatic past -- from the present day, in which the snowman reigns as the King of Kitsch, to the Dark Ages, with the creation of the very first snowman. Eckstein&#39;s curiosity began playfully enough, but soon snowballed into a (mostly) earnest quest of chasing Frosty around the world, into museums and libraries, and seeking out the advice of leading historians and scholars. The result is a riveting history that reaches back through centuries and across cultures -- sweeping from fifteenth-century Italian snowballs to eighteenth-century Russian ice sculptures to the regrettable &#34;white-trash years&#34; (1975-2000). The snowman is not just part of our childhood memories, but is an integral part of our world culture, appearing -- much like a frozen Forrest Gump -- alongside dignitaries and celebrities during momentous events. Again and again, the snowman pops up in rare prints, paintings, early movies, advertising and, over the past century, in every art form imaginable. And the jolly snowman -- ostensibly as pure as the driven snow -- also harbors a dark past full of political intrigue, sex, and violence.</p><p><b>Bob Eckstein</b> has been a humor writer for more than twenty years, and is most recognized for his popular weekly columns in Newsday, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and now, <i>TimeOut</i>.

Our society's stance on size is that it still matters. From SUVs to plasma-screen TVs to McMansions to six-foot heroes, living large is being in charge. Putting deli meats aside, today we all want to make an entrance with class, and right now that means the largest diamond, the biggest pecs, the largest breasts, and the most headroom of any sedan on the market. This preoccupation carries over to Christmas decorations, which have gone to another level -- it's not enough to keep up with the Joneses; it's necessary to squash them like a bug. So it's no surprise that our snowmen now need to be either a world-record holders or rubbernecking freaks of nature. Snowman contests, snowman festivals, marathons, lollapaloozas...like much else today, if it's not a spectacle, ­ don't bother. </p><p> Today if you want a snowman for your lawn, you drive to the store. In an attempt to find another angle to cash in on the holidays, price clubs and better stores everywhere are well stocked with inflatable snowmen and snowman "kits." In this get-it-done-before-it-snows, fast-paced world of ours, there are different brands of snowman kits to choose from, all with prefabricated hats, buttons, pseudo coal and carrots conveniently packaged in a box so you or your kids don't have to get up and look for them yourself. Yes, everyone's snowman is going to look the same, but think of the time we're all saving. We're all too busy to go out and make snowmen, and, besides, what's the point of making one less than twelve feet tall? The buying of the largest possible snowman comes on the heels of The White Trash Years (1975-2000) as a backlash against all those cutesy gift-shop snowmen we all got sick of up to here. But that's the cynical side of the story. The positive spin on this is that "Mr. Huge" and other inflatable rubber substitutes of the real McCoy finally give those who live in temperate regions the joy of having a snowman in their front yard. Think of the children. Think of the money. </p><p> Speaking of which, what about snowman making as sport and its gambling opportunities? It's all part of The Age of Expansion, when the snowman continues to blaze trails for tourism. Hundreds of snowman festivals and contests take place around the world every year and continue to grow. In Pennsylvania, there's an annual charity ice golf tournament on Lake Wallenpaupack after it freezes that includes a contest where golfers tee it up and aim for the vulnerable "Wally, the Snowman" down the fairway. </p><p> There are hundreds of similar events throughout the world. The biggest is the Ice Lantern Festival (Ice and Snow World) in Harbin. This bitterly cold, northern Chinese city, once known mainly for its expensive exotica cuisine of bear paws, deer nostrils, and white Siberian tiger testicles, is now recognized as the ice sculpture capital, attracting artists from around the world. Each year millions travel to the "Ice City," where the temperature stays below freezing nearly half the year. Held from the beginning of January to the end of February, thousands of enormous sculptures and buildings are exhibited and paraded on floats through the city. Although these snow shows date back to 1963, snow sculpture there dates back to the Qing dynasty about 350 years ago. During the Manchu days, "ice lanterns" were carved and then lit by placing candles in them. </p><p> A similar tradition is also enjoyed today throughout Japan, where snowmen have candles placed in their stomachs during the many snowman festivals that take place every winter. Each year snowmen outnumber, at least for a while, the populations of northern Japanese towns. But are they big snowmen? Well, no, but rumor has it that the Japanese are eyeing that big prize, the world's largest snowman, an honor they enjoyed for almost four years thanks to a ninety-six-foot-tall snowman. Then, in February of 1999, Bethel, a town in Maine, placed itself on the map by breaking the coveted record, spending fourteen days piling snow skyward into what would become Angus, the King of the Mountain, named after the Maine governor, Angus King. </p><p> Extreme snowman making has come a long way since the day a bunch of frat boys from Dartmouth made the thirty-eight-foot-high Eleazer Wheelock, the headline act for the 1939 Winter Carnival. Today, making a huge snowman involves cranes, teamsters, and insurance. Don't even think about making a snowball the size of an igloo without a working permit. In Bethel, their record-breaking snowman required sixty volunteers, ranging from kindergartners to senior citizens and the cooperation of the whole town. Angus's arms were made with two ten-foot evergreens. Volunteers created a mouth with six automobile tires and eyes with four-foot wreaths. The local elementary school made a six-foot carrot out of chicken wire and muslin and then painted it orange by having each student place his or her handprint on it. When finished, Angus reached 113 feet and entered the <i>The Guinness Book of Records</i>, attracting thousands of visitors and appearing on <i>Good Morning America</i>. Afterward, the town held a contest to guess when Angus would melt, and by mid-March, Angus had become "The Leaning Tower of Bethel." </p><p> Not every large snowman dies a quiet, slow death. Each year in Zurich, the Swiss celebrate <i>Sechsel�uten</i> by using large amounts of explosives to blow up an innocent snowman. Always on the third Monday in April, bakers, butchers, blacksmiths, and other tradesmen parade on horses and throw bread and sausages to the crowds. In return for free meat, girls decorate the riders with garlands made of spring flowers. <i>Sechsel�uten</i> (which means "six bells ringing") comes from the tradition that, at six o'clock, the guild members put down their tools and call it a day. Meanwhile, the <i>Boogg</i> is schlepped through town. The Boogg is a large, cotton-wool snowman with a corncob pipe, button nose, and two eyes made out of coal -- he looks the same every year because the same guy has been making the <i>Boogg</i> for over thirty-five years. Unfortunately for Mr. Boogg, he's filled with firecrackers and plopped onto a forty-foot pile of very flammable scrap wood. For him, things will only get worse. After the bells of the Church of St. Peter have chimed six times, representing the passing of winter, the townspeople light the pile and watch the carnage. It is believed the shorter the combustion, the hotter and longer the summer will be. When the head of the snowman explodes to smithereens, winter is considered officially over. </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by Bob Eckstein</p></p><h2>Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi Volume 1 - Force Storm</h2><p>Here begins the tale of the dawn of the Jedi, the Star Wars of 25,000 years ago - before lightsabers, before hyperspace travel, before the Jedi spread throughout the galaxy, when connections to the Force were new.

Relying on the words of the delegates themselves to explore the Convention's sharp conflicts and hard bargaining, David O. Stewart lays out the passions and contradictions of the often painful process of writing the Constitution. </p><p> It was a desperate balancing act. Revolutionary principles required that the people have power, but could the people be trusted? Would a stronger central government leave room for the states? Would the small states accept a Congress in which seats were alloted according to population rather than to each sovereign state? And what of slavery? The supercharged debates over America's original sin led to the most creative and most disappointing political deals of the Convention. </p><p> The room was crowded with colorful and passionate characters, some known -- Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Randolph -- and others largely forgotten. At different points during that sultry summer, more than half of the delegates threatened to walk out, and some actually did, but Washington's quiet leadership and the delegates' inspired compromises held the Convention together. </p><p> In a country continually arguing over the document's original intent, it is fascinating to watch these powerful characters struggle toward consensus -- often reluctantly -- to write a flawed but living and breathing document that could evolve with the nation.</p></p><p><strong>David O. Stewart</strong> is the author of the highly acclaimed <i>The Summer of 1987: The Men Who Invented the Constitution</i> and <i>Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Jackson and the Fight for Lincoln&#x2019;s Legacy</i>.<p> <b>Chapter Four </b></p><p><b> <i>Demigods and Coxcombs Assemble</i> </b></p><p><b> MAY 1787</b> </p><p> </p><p> James Madison reached Philadelphia on May 3, ten whole days before any other delegate (except for the ones who lived there), and eleven days before the Convention was scheduled to begin. His early arrival reflected both his eagerness and his lifelong habit of exacting preparation. Always gentle with his health when he could be, the Virginian gave himself ample time to recover from the grinding stagecoach ride from New York, where he had been representing Virginia in the Confederation Congress. </p><p> Although Philadelphia was the nation's largest city, home to about 40,000 people, lodging was at a premium. In addition to the Federal Convention (as it was called), the city was hosting a gathering of Presbyterian ministers from around the country. Also in town was the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of Continental Army officers that some feared as a political force. <i>The Pennsylvania Herald</i> took pride in the confluence: </p><blockquote> <p> Here, at the same moment, the collective wisdom of the continent deliberates upon the extensive politics of the confederated empire, an Episcopal convention clears and distributes the streams of religion throughout the American world, and those veterans whose valor and perseverance accomplished a mighty revolution are once more assembled. . . . </p></blockquote> <p> Madison settled in at Mrs. House's boardinghouse at Fifth and Market, where Virginians on public business often stayed. It was familiar ground. Madison had lodged with Mrs. House in 1783 during his first term in the Confederation Congress, and the quiet, serious Virginian was little trouble. As one contemporary described him, "His ordinary manner was simple, modest, bland, and unostentatious, retiring from the throng and cautiously refraining from doing or saying anything to make himself conspicuous." Another attributed to him "an air of reflection which is not very distant from gravity and self-sufficiency," but also found "little of that warmth of heart." </p><p> In the ten days until the next delegate arrived, Madison could review the two essays he had written in anticipation of the great convention. The first was an examination of republics and confederacies throughout history, including Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany, along with classical examples -- the Lycian, Amphictyonic, and Achean republics. His second essay, called "Madison's Vices" in ironic tribute to its author's undoubted virtue, was an incisive catalog of the infirmities of the Articles. The vices numbered eleven, and the remedy for all of them was a strong central government. The Virginian was keenly aware of the risk that strong governments may take oppressive measures, as the British Parliament had. His goal was a government that not only was strong, but also would respect the rights of its citizens. </p><p> For Madison, the accommodation of competing forces was the central job of government. "All civilized societies are divided into different interests and factions," he wrote, including "debtors or creditors," "rich or poor," "members of different religious sects," "followers of different political leaders," "inhabitants of different districts," or "husbandmen, merchants or manufacturers." Government must be "sufficiently neutral between the different interests and factions, to control one part of the society from invading the rights of another." </p><p> During those ten days on his own, Madison did more than plan for the coming conclave. Correspondence from home forced his attention to his responsibilities as a slave owner. Had other servants or slaves assisted the escape of Anthony, a runaway brought back to the plantation? Madison had to judge the case from afar. He also called on Dr. Benjamin Franklin, his fellow delegate and recently installed as president of Pennsylvania. Feeling his eighty-one years, Franklin went out little but was happy to receive guests in his garden, particularly under a favorite mulberry tree. Knowing of the slight Virginian's role in pushing for the Convention and of his relationship with Washington, Franklin extended to the younger man the respect warranted by both. </p><p> General Washington arrived second, having taken five days to cover the 140 miles from Mount Vernon in his own carriage, driven by his slaves. The contrast with Madison's quiet entry into Philadelphia was stark. </p><p> At midday on May 13, the General was at Mrs. Withy's Inn in Chester, south of the city, dining with former army colleagues. The party pressed on to a greeting by the Philadelphia Light Horse, nattily turned out in white britches, high boots, and black and silver hats. The troopers escorted the hero over a floating bridge that spanned the Schuylkill River. An artillery company fired a thirteen-gun salute (once for each state), church bells pealed, and cheering crowds lined the streets despite what the <i>Pennsylvania Herald</i> called "the badness of the weather." It was another demonstration, if one was needed, that it was within the General's power to be an American Caesar. </p><p> Like Madison, Washington had taken rooms with Mrs. House. Alighting at her establishment, he was met by the financier Robert Morris and his wife, who prevented the General from unloading his luggage. Washington had declined the Morrises' written offer of lodging during the Convention, but they would not accept his refusal in person. They bundled the General to their home, acclaimed the finest in the city, a short walk away. Washington did not tarry there, but immediately set off to pay his own respects to Dr. Franklin. Along that four-block jaunt, he shook hands with Philadelphians, who cheered and gaped at the tall man with such an impressive bearing. </p><p> Though the Morrises' intervention meant that Madison and Washington would not share the same roof, the studious younger man must have felt a particular satisfaction in the General's arrival. Applying the General's stature to Madison's strategy, they had formed an effective partnership in bringing the Convention to pass. Madison was relying on that partnership to continue through the summer. Their challenges would increase as Philadelphia filled with delegates who had different visions of the nation to be formed, and different interests to protect. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> On the next morning, May 14, Washington and Madison walked the short distance to the Pennsylvania State House (today called Independence Hall) for the scheduled opening of the Convention. They strode through a light drizzle with three more Virginians who had just arrived -- George Wythe, John Blair, and James McClurg. </p><p> Wythe, sixty-one, was America's first law professor. At the College of William and Mary he trained a generation of leaders that included Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and James Monroe. A signer of the Declaration of Independence and former Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, Wythe was his state's leading judge from 1778 until his death in 1806. Blair, fifty-five, served alongside Wythe on Virginia's chancery court and had participated in his state's constitutional convention. McClurg, forty-one, a physician and professor at William and Mary, was a member of Virginia's executive council. </p><p> Thanks to a cold winter and a wet spring, the Virginians shared the streets with Philadelphia's aggravating black flies, which would linger through the humid summer. At the State House, they found only one other delegation, the Pennsylvanians led by Dr. Franklin. Raw weather had delayed many delegates, but the Pennsylvanians brought flair enough for the occasion. </p><p> The Pennsylvania Assembly elected its delegates in late 1786, almost two months before Congress endorsed the Convention. As the second largest state (after Virginia), Pennsylvania was essential to any effort to remake the government. The state's cosmopolitan outlook derived from its diverse population, which included German immigrants, Quakers, and free blacks. Where the Virginians had forebears rooted in their state's soil for a century and more, the eight Pennsylvanians were more mobile and more urban. Three were immigrants: Thomas Fitzsimons from Ireland, Robert Morris from England, and James Wilson from Scotland. Three hailed from other states: Connecticut (Jared Ingersoll), New York (Gouverneur Morris, who still lived there), and Massachusetts (Franklin). </p><p> All eight Pennsylvanians worked at city-based pursuits like trade and law. Only a week before, six of them had been at Dr. Franklin's for a session of the Society for Political Inquiries. The presentation was on American trade and manufacturing, matters of less than the first moment to Virginia planters, but central to the national future. </p><p> At the Convention, the most prominent Pennsylvania delegates were the ones chosen last. When the state Assembly voted, James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris trailed less-distinguished colleagues by a wide margin, while Franklin was omitted altogether because he was thought too ill to serve. He was later unanimously added to the delegation when his health proved adequate to the task. Each of those three brought noteworthy qualities. </p><p> None could match Dr. Franklin for political theater, beginning with his universally recognized title of "Doctor." The title dated from his honorary degree from St. Andrews in Scotland, granted for his scientific achievements (as were his honorary degrees from Oxford, Harvard, Yale, and William and Mary -- not bad for a man who left school at the age of ten). </p><p> When attending diplomatic soir�es in Paris, his theatrical instincts had draped him in American homespun and crowned him with fur caps. Now he challenged American rusticity by traveling in a glass-windowed sedan chair from France, borne by four husky prisoners from the nearby Walnut Street jail. As Dr. Franklin progressed through Philadelphia's republican streets, his regal trappings drove home the message that honor in America grew from talent, not birth. Yet the swaying procession also must have brought a smile to those it passed, and to the doctor himself. </p></p><h2>The Sexual Celibate</h2><p>A theologian delineates the sexual and spiritual aspects of the life of the celibate</p><p></p><h2>Ojo De Dios: Eye of God.</h2><p>Describes the basic materials and techniques used in crafting various traditional Ojo designs</p><p></p><h2>Burma-Shave: The Rhymes, the Signs, the Times</h2><p>For thirty years, the series of six signs posted along roadways were an icon of American life.

Franciszka and her daughter, Helena, are simple, ordinary people...until 1939, when the Nazis invade their homeland. Providing shelter to Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland is a death sentence, but Franciszka and Helena do exactly that. In their tiny home in Sokal, they hide a Jewish family in a loft above their pigsty, a Jewish doctor with his wife and son in a makeshift cellar under the kitchen, and a defecting German soldier in the attic&#x2014;each party completely unknown to the others. For everyone to survive, Franciszka will have to outsmart her neighbors and the German commander. Told simply and succinctly from four different perspectives&#x2014;all under one roof&#x2014;My Mother&#x2019;s Secret is a testament to the kindness, courage, and generosity o</p><p>JL Witterick grew up in Canada, experiencing the multi-cultural environment which influenced her thinking about how different people can live in harmony. &nbsp;She has always been interested in Holocaust stories, finding the courage of many during this period to be touching and inspirational. &nbsp;She loves to write and wanted her debut novel to be meaningful. &nbsp;The warm response that she has received from readers is like a dream come true. &nbsp;<i>My Mother&#x2019;s Secret</i> is a bestseller in Canada and has been published in several countries around the world.&nbsp;Witterick has donated 100 percent of the advance from the book to various charities. &nbsp;These include providing books for children from impoverished communities, funding for medical research, and financial support for animal shelters. &nbsp;She loves all animals and considers her dog and cat to be part of her family. &nbsp;Witterick hopes that by writing this story and donating the proceeds from the advance, she will have honored those known as The Righteous Among the Nations.This book is fictional, but it was inspired by the true story of Franciszka Halamajowa, who with her daughter saved the lives of fifteen Jews in Poland during the Second World War. She also hid a young German soldier in her attic at the same time. Her son died while transporting a wagon full of supplies to partisan Jews hiding in the forest.&nbsp;Before the war, there were six thousand Jews in Sokal, Poland. Only thirty survived the war and half of those because of one Polish woman, Franciszka.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all of us, like Franciszka, have within us the potential to be great. Sometimes we coast through life without this potential surfacing because life has been easy on us.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have much to lose, but still choose to do the right thing, we uncover the nobility that is within all of us. To endure what is unbearable and to do it with grace, that is how we know that we have arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trip to Israel</b>&nbsp;In 2012, I visited Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, where there is a tree planted and a plaque to honor Franciszka Halamajowa and her daughter, Helena.&nbsp;&nbsp;People who were not Jewish, but who nevertheless risked their lives to help the Jews escape execution during the Holocaust, are recognized as &#x201c;the Righteous among the Nations&#x201d; in Israel. This is how Franciszka and her daughter are remembered.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my son, Matthew, who actually found the tree, as bushes had grown in front of the plaque, preventing me from seeing it initially.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon seeing their names there in print before me, I was overcome with emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had written about this woman and her daughter and had imagined their lives, but here was evidence that they indeed did exist. I didn&#x2019;t realize how deeply I would feel until this moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Planting a tree to remember them by feels so right.&nbsp;</p><h2>Black Snow</h2><p>A new edition of Bulgakov&#x2019;s blistering satire about the great Russian director Stanislavski, inventor of &#x201c;Method acting,&#x201d; part of Melville House&#x2019;s reissue of the Bulgakov backlist in Michael Glenny&#x2019;s celebrated translations.<br><br>In 1926, a play based on Mikhail Bulgakov&#x2019;s novel <i>The White Guard</i> premiered at the prestigious Moscow Arts Theatre and it was an immediate and long-lasting success that laid the ground for the rest of Bulgakov&#x2019;s career as a playwright and novelist. <br><br>But it was not an entirely positive experience, and this novel, written near the end of Bulgakov&#x2019;s life, skewers the theatrical fraternity he had been a part of for many years, and the Stalinist system of censorship that suppressed his work. <br><br><i>Black Snow</i> is the story of Maxudov, a young playwright whose play is chosen, almost at random, to be performed by the legendary Independent Theatre, and the chaos that ensues. The two co-directors of the theater, modeled after Stanislavski and his co-director, battle to control the production, star actresses throw daily fits, and with each rehearsal the chances of the play ever being ready to perform recedes. The ultimate backstage novel and a brilliant satire from one of the greatest modern Russian writers.</p><p>MIKHAIL BULGAKOV was born in Kiev on May 15th 1891. He graduated as a doctor but gave up the practice of medicine in 1920 to devote himself to literature. He went on to write some of the greatest novels in twentieth century Russian literature, including&nbsp;<i>The White Guard</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heart of a Dog</i>, and his masterpiece,&nbsp;<i>The Master and Margarita</i>. He died in Moscow of kidney disease in 1940.<br><br><b>MICHAEL GLENNY</b>&nbsp;(1927-1990) was one of the world's leading translators of Russian literature, translating the works of Gogol and Dostoevsky.

Judge Corliss asked. "Cat got your tongue?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were only twenty people in the large room. There was the law secretary assigned to Corliss, who was sitting beside him, scribbling notes in her log; the clerk, who was at his desk to the left, pretending to fumble with the day's calendar; the stenographer, who had rested his hands at his side when Corliss started to yell; a defense attorney sitting at counsel table, looking over his shoulder and laughing at me; and the defendant himself-on trial for first-degree rape-fixated on the pretty face of the young law secretary who was working with the judge. The others, except for the jury and my colleague, Helen, had probably been corralled by the defense attorney to pretend to be family members interested in the outcome of the trial.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I raised my hands to my sides, palms up, and just shrugged at Corliss.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Looks like I lose my bet, Alexandra," the judge said, standing up on his raised platform and pulling back his black gown-hands on his hips-expecting everyone would admire his fit torso and his bespoke shirt with monogrammed cuffs. "You're going to cost me fifty bucks."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Alex," Helen said, leaning closer to me as she whispered. "I didn't want to bother you on your first day back in the office, but Corliss is totally trying to steamroll over me and I don't have the experience to stand up to him."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Pay attention to me," Corliss said to me. "Not your sidekick. Ms. Wyler will get it right one of these days, with or without your help."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now the defendant's entourage was engaged, too, trying to figure out who I was and why the judge was spending time and energy on me.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Fifty large, Alexandra. I bet three of the other judges in the lunchroom you'd never set foot in this building again."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I poked Helen in the side so that she would get to her feet and address Corliss from her proper place, within the well of the courtroom.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She stood and pushed through the low wooden gate, taking her place at counsel table.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"May I have ten minutes with Ms. Cooper?" she asked.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The defendant-a serial rapist who specialized in attacking teenagers-put his head in his hands and groaned.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You can have ten, Ms. Wyler," Corliss said, "so long as I get fifteen."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The witness room is empty, Your Honor," Helen said. "We'll just go in there."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm first," Corliss said. He motioned to me with his forefinger, telling me to approach him so we could have a private conversation. "And you'll stay right where you are, Ms. Wyler."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I ignored his summons and walked to the prosecution table, which was stacked high with trial folders and papers. Helen stepped back briskly, as though moving away from an out-of-control car coming in her direction.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why the silent treatment, Alexandra?" Corliss asked.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to the stenographer, who had recorded the testimony at several of my trials. "Lenny, let's go on the record, please."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Who's giving the orders in here? Somebody make you a judge while I wasn't looking?" Corliss asked. "Lenny, why don't you go help yourself to a cup of coffee?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Lenny stood up to leave the room, I turned my back to the bench and started to retrace my steps.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Whoa, whoa!" Corliss said. "Let's slow this down, Alexandra."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raymond Santiago looked up, leaning over past his lawyer to check out the minor commotion. His right hand moved instinctively to his groin, where he seemed to like to keep it most of the time, when he wasn't stalking his victims. What Santiago's lawyer referred to as his client's hypersexuality was likely to be on constant display for the jury.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I swiveled again. "I'm happy to talk to you, Your Honor," I said. "I want everything we say to be on the record. That's why I didn't answer when you first called out to me."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Stick around, Lenny," Judge Corliss said, motioning to the stenographer to sit. "Ms. Cooper wants on the record, we'll give her on the record. Like I was saying, she's just back from-"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I wasn't dead, Your Honor," I said, smiling at him. "Sorry to disappoint, but I wasn't even on life support."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Honorable Bud Corliss liked to bully young assistants like Helen Wyler. He would shut down the stenographer and launch verbal arrows at the prosecutors, each one tipped with a poisonous comment about his or her skills. Sometimes, if his target was an attractive young woman, he'd add a remark about her anatomy. Then, if she chose to complain to a superior about the comment, there were no traces of Corliss's bad behavior in the transcript.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I guess you really dodged a bullet, in the most literal sense," he said, sitting in his high-back leather chair and adjusting his gold cuff links. "I mean, the night your late lamented boss was shot in the head just a few feet away from you-dodging that bullet."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a conversation I didn't want to have in front of strangers-no less a perp charged with seventeen counts of rape and aggravated sexual assault.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Strike that word 'lamented,'" Corliss said to Lenny, editing his own remarks. "Not everybody got broken up about the forced retirement of Paul Battaglia after a few too many terms in office, did they, Alexandra?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The district attorney mentored me, Your Honor," I said. "He put me in charge of the Special Victims Bureau a dozen years ago. I had nothing but respect for the man."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let me ask you something," he said, leaning forward and putting both elbows on his blotter. "I have a few questions about what happened that-"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Judge Corliss, this is neither the time nor place," I said. "You've got jurors waiting for the testimony to resume, my colleague is anxious to complete the People's case by the end of the week, and the defendant-well . . ."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What about him?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mr. Santiago probably needs to get some medical attention for that itch in his groin he keeps scratching throughout our conversation," I said. "This might be a good time to give him a short restroom break and throw him some calamine lotion before I have Ms. Wyler add in a count of masturbating in a public place."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good to know you haven't lost your sense of humor, Alexandra," Corliss said as Santiago's inexperienced court-appointed lawyer struggled to find grounds for an objection. "Ten-minute break, ladies and gentlemen. Let's clear the courtroom."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Court officers handcuffed the prisoner and took him out to the holding pen that serviced the thirteenth-floor trial rooms. His hangers-on-impervious to my comments-wandered out into the large corridor that ran the entire length of the enormous building.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat at counsel table with Helen Wyler. "What do you need?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I've made a terrible mistake, Alex," she said. "I don't think I'll get my first two victims back here if Corliss declares a mistrial."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What have you done?" I asked.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The fifteen-year-old who testified Friday-the one who was raped on the rooftop at Taft Houses?" Helen said.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, I remember." I knew the case well. Helen had indicted it before my leave had started almost three months earlier-after an incident that was unrelated to the murder of the district attorney.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"On cross this morning, she admitted texting me six or seven times before the trial began," Helen said, slouching lower in her chair.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Did she?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah, she did."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But you didn't turn the texts over to the defense?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could see Corliss out of the corners of my eyes, pacing back and forth, trying to catch a fragment of our conversation.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The texts weren't significant to the case facts, Alex," Helen said to me, stopping to bite her lip. "Graciela was just asking if she had to see Santiago in the courtroom and about how terrified she was to be within twenty feet of him. That kind of stuff."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The perp had grabbed the girl as she got off an elevator to go to her home in the projects, holding a knife to her neck to force her to the roof, where he raped her repeatedly for almost two hours.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That kind of stuff, as you call it," I said, as calmly as I could, "is still Rosario Material. The defense is entitled to every one of those texts, Helen. You know that as well as I do."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They got away from me," she said. "They were coming in at all hours of the night and somehow they just got away from me."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So you didn't print them out?" I asked. "You didn't save them?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Graciela's emails, yes. The defense has them all. Her texts-well, I just forgot."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The New York Court of Appeals had mandated the disclosure of all of a prosecution witness's prior recorded statements in a ruling in the Rosario case, many decades ago. Each new form of social media ratcheted up the number of ways a nervous witness could communicate.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Corliss knows?" I asked.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, because of her answers on cross," Helen said. "He's threatening to strike all of Graciela's testimony. Maybe even declare a mistrial. I'm screwed if he does that. She'll never go through this again."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How much time has he given you?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Until tomorrow morning," Helen said, avoiding eye contact with me and lifting her head to stare at the light fixtures on the ceiling. "But that won't help because they don't exist. I deleted them."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Have you tried TARU?" I asked, putting my hand on hers, which was on top of a pile of her notes. "They're wizards."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit was a small, elite force of detectives responsible for all investigative tech support and the most complex computer forensics.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Helen shook her head. "I was too embarrassed to tell the SVU detectives last night. I just assumed it was a lost cause once I hit Delete. I've never worked a matter with TARU."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Focus on your case," I said, standing up. "Where's your phone?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Top desk drawer."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It won't be there when you get downstairs, but you'll have it back tonight," I said. "These TARU guys can retrieve stuff that's gone off into the Twilight Zone. Nothing ever gets fatally lost in the ether. Tell Corliss you'll have what he wants by morning."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Shouldn't I ask for an adjournment?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Call your next witness, Helen," I said. "Raymond Santiago has preyed on young girls for the last time. Just don't let Corliss beat you down along the way."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stepped away from her and waved to Corliss. "Thanks for giving me the time."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Now I get my fifteen with you," he said, tucking his thumbs into the front of his leather belt, the sides of his robe pushed back, and striding down the three steps from his bench to walk to his robing room. "C'mon, Alexandra."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Helen Wyler was on her feet, apologizing to me for putting me in the judge's scope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's okay. But don't you ever do what I'm about to do," I said. "The man's a pig. Don't let him bully you into being alone with him."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But you-"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I had my first felony trial in front of Corliss a dozen years ago," I said. "My entire team were guys-really good guys. You've met them all. My knees used to wobble when he demanded that I come into his robing room to discuss a plea deal or a procedural issue. So my pals swore that if I ever walked out with any of the judge's dandruff on my suit, they'd know I'd been too close to him and they'd take him down."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Helen laughed.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thanks for your concern," I said, "but at this stage in our relationship, Corliss doesn't have any real interest in me-and he certainly lacks the balls to take me on."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I followed him into the small cubicle behind the courtroom. There was a wooden chair and desk and two more chairs for visitors. Bud Corliss was staring out the window, looking down at the traffic on Centre Street.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You've had a rough autumn," he said, his back to me. "First the kidnapping, and then the shock of witnessing Battaglia's murder."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a pretty miserable couple of months, but I'm back on my feet, Judge," I said. "And I didn't mean to be rude when I came into your courtroom, but I just wasn't ready to throw this all out in front of Santiago and his crew."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was being polite now, more for Helen Wyler's sake-and the salvation of her case-than my own.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You ready for the grind?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You know I love it. My friends and family have been great, and my shrink is amazingly solid. Nobody seemed to like me when I was whining and needy, so I might as well do the one thing I know how to do."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bud Corliss turned around to face me, half sitting on the radiator cover below the windowsill. "You think they got the right guys? I mean, Battaglia's killers?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I do." I had been involved in that investigation up to my eyeballs.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There were so many rumors floating around," Corliss said.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Most of them were groundless and stupid, but you know how that goes," I said.<br><br> "Some of them even had me as a conspirator in his murder."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Then there's all the gossip about you running to take his place."<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's just what it is, Judge. Gossip," I said, laughing with him. "You've known me a long time. Do you think I have the temperament for politics?"<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You'd be easier on the eyes than that mean old bastard you worked for," Corliss said, tiptoeing toward the line that he had crossed so many times before, as he looked me up and down, from the ankles to the...</p></p><h2>Gentleman: The William Powell Story</h2><p>A tribute to actor William Powell details his short-lived marriage to Carole Lombard, tragic romance with Jean Harlow, forty-year marriage to Diana Lewis, and his remarkable film career</p><p></p><h2>Selected writings of Alexandra Kollontai</h2><p>Colorful history of this post near the Missouri-Kansas border.

We were driving up Beverly Glen when the sirens cut through the darkness, ululating, like coyote death wails.<br><br>The noise died quickly, indicating a nearby disaster, but there was no reason to assume the worst. Unless you&#x2019;re the worst kind of fatalist, you think: &#x201c;Something lousy happened to some poor devil.&#x201d;<br><br>That night, I learned different.<br><br>Since then, the Klaxon of an ambulance or a fire truck in my neighborhood sets off something inside me&#x2014;a crimp of shoulder, a catch of breath, an arrhythmic flutter of the plum-colored thing in my chest.<br><br>Pavlov was right.<br><br>I&#x2019;m trained as a clinical psychologist, could do something about it but have chosen not to. Sometimes anxiety makes me feel alive.<br>When the sirens shrieked, Milo and I were having dinner at an Italian place at the top of the Glen. It was ten-thirty on a cool June night. The restaurant closes at eleven, but we were the last patrons, and the waiter was looking tired. The woman I was now seeing was teaching a night course in abnormal psychology at the U., and Milo&#x2019;s partner, Rick Silverman, was busy at the Cedars-Sinai ER trying to salvage the five most seriously injured victims of a ten-car pileup on the Santa Monica Freeway.<br><br>Milo had just closed the file on a robbery-turned-to-multiple- homicide at a liquor store on Pico Boulevard. The solve had taken more persistence than brainwork. He was in a position to pick his cases, and no new ones had crossed his desk.<br><br>I&#x2019;d finally finished testifying at the seemingly endless child-custody hearings waged by a famous director and his famous actress wife. I&#x2019;d begun the consult with some optimism. The director had once been an actor, and both he and his ex knew how to perform. Now, three years later, two kids who&#x2019;d started out in pretty good shape were basket cases living in France.<br><br>Milo and I chewed our way through focaccia and baby artichoke salad, orrechiati stuffed with spinach, veal pounded to paper. Neither of us felt like talking. A bottle of decent white wine smoothed the silence. Both of us were strangely content; life wasn&#x2019;t fair, but we&#x2019;d done our jobs well.<br><br>When sirens came, I kept my eyes on my plate. Milo stopped eating. The napkin he&#x2019;d tucked in his shirt collar was spotted with spinach and olive oil.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not a fire.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s worrying?&#x201d;<br><br>He pushed hair off his forehead, picked up his fork and knife, speared, chewed, swallowed.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That it&#x2019;s not a big-red? Trust me, Alex. It&#x2019;s a black-and-white. I know the frequency.&#x201d;<br><br>A second cruiser wailed by. Then a third.<br><br>He pulled his tiny blue cell phone out of his pocket and punched a button. A preset number rang.<br><br>I raised my eyebrows.<br><br>&#x201c;Just curious,&#x201d; he said. His connection went through, and he told the phone, &#x201c;This is Lieutenant Sturgis. What call just went out in the vicinity of upper Beverly Glen? Yeah, near Mulholland.&#x201d; He waited, green eyes dimmed to near brown in the miserly light of the restaurant. Under the spotted napkin was a baby blue polo shirt that really didn&#x2019;t work well with his pallid complexion. His acne pits were flagrant, his jowls gravid as freshly filled wineskins. Long white sideburns frizzed his big face, a pair of skunkish stripes that seemed to sprout artificially from his black hair. He&#x2019;s a gay policeman and my best friend.<br><br>&#x201c;That so,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Any detective assigned, yet? Okay, listen, I happen to be right near there, can make it over in ten&#x2014;no make that fifteen&#x2014;make it twenty minutes. Yeah, yeah, sure.&#x201d;<br><br>He snapped the little phone shut. &#x201c;Double homicide, two bodies in a car. Being this close, I figured I should have a look. The crime scene&#x2019;s still being secured, and the techs haven&#x2019;t gotten there, so we can still have dessert. How are you with cannoli?&#x201d;<br>We split the check, and he offered to drive me home, but neither of us took that seriously.<br><br>&#x201c;In that case,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll take the Seville.&#x201d;<br><br>I drove quickly. The crime scene was on the west side of the intersection between the Glen and Mulholland, up a skinny, decomposed, granite road marked private that climbed through sycamore-crowned hillside.<br><br>A police cruiser was stationed at the mouth of the road. Staked to a tree several feet up was a for sale sign bearing the logo of a Westside Realtor. Milo flashed the badge to the uniform in the car, and we drove through.<br><br>At the top of the road was a house behind high, night-blackened hedges. Two more black-and-whites kept us ten yards back. We parked and continued on foot. The sky was purplish, the air still bitter with the smolder of two early-summer brush fires, one up near Camarillo, the other past Tujunga. Both had just been vanquished. One had been set by a fireman.<br><br>Behind the hedges was stout wooden fencing. Double gates had been left open. The bodies slumped in a red Mustang convertible parked on a semicircular flagstone driveway. The house behind the drive was a vacant mansion, a big neo-Spanish thing that was probably cheerful peach in the daylight. At this hour, it was putty gray.<br><br>The driveway bordered a half acre of front yard, shaded by more sycamores&#x2014;giant ones. The house looked newish and was ruined by too many weird-shaped windows, but someone had been smart enough to spare the trees.<br><br>The top was down on the little red car. I stood back and watched as Milo approached, careful to stay behind the tape. He did nothing but stare. Moments later, a pair of crime-scene techs walked onto the property lugging cases on a dolly. They talked to him briefly, then slipped under the tape.<br><br>He walked back to the Seville. &#x201c;Looks like gunshot wounds to both heads, a guy and a girl, young. He&#x2019;s in the driver&#x2019;s seat, she&#x2019;s next to him. His fly&#x2019;s open, and his shirt&#x2019;s half-unbuttoned. Her shirt&#x2019;s clean off, tossed in the backseat along with her bra. Under the shirt she wore black leggings. They&#x2019;re rolled down to her ankles, and her legs are spread.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lover&#x2019;s lane thing?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Empty house,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good neighborhood. Probably a nice view from the backyard. Seize the night and all that? Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they knew about the house, they could be locals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He looked clean-cut, well dressed. Yeah, I&#x2019;d say local is also a decent bet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder why the gate was left open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or maybe it wasn&#x2019;t, and one of them has some connection to the house and a gate-clicker. For all we know, one of their families built the place. Crime Scene will do their thing, hopefully they&#x2019;ll find IDs in the pockets. The car&#x2019;s plates are being run right now.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Any gun in sight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A murder-suicide thing? Not likely.&#x201d;<br><br>He rubbed his face. His hand lingered at his mouth, tugged down his lower lip and let it snap back up.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Two head-shots plus, Alex. Someone jammed what looks to be a short spear or a crossbow bolt into the girl&#x2019;s torso. Here.&#x201d; He touched a spot under his breastbone. &#x201c;From what I could see the damn thing went clear through her and is lodged in the seat. The impact jolted her body, she&#x2019;s lying funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A spear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was skewered, Alex. A bullet to the brain wasn&#x2019;t enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Overkill,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A message. Were they actually making love or were they positioned sexually?&#x201d;<br><br>He flashed a frightening smile. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re veering into your territory.&#x201d;</p><h2>Classic Salmon Flies: History &amp; Patterns</h2><p>*** Please Read This *** New book - Ships from Ohio - No Markings - Fast Shipping- Free tracking - K-9-A</p><p></p><h2>The Spiritual Rules of Engagement: How Kabbalah Can Help Your Soul Mate Find You</h2><p>More than a decade after the runaway bestseller <i>The Rules</i> advised women on how to land "Mr. Right," it&#x2019;s time for a new set of rules that takes a more spiritual approach.

Then two cars.<br><br> No one slowed.<br><br> Just make a call, she prayed. 411. 911. Report the crazy lady standing in the rain. The one at Saint Patrick&#x2019;s&#x2014;a landmark, tourist destination, and religious refuge, all rolled into one.<br><br> She took another step. Craned her neck through the gloom toward the scaffolding high above.<br><br> Was he watching?<br><br> Another step.<br><br> Tears welled in her eyes, mingling with the rain. She knew that Saint Patrick&#x2019;s was a symbol. The sign she carried was a symbol, too. Even the confession she&#x2019;d been forced to make was only a symbol. And for all her nonbelieving, she was terrified that she was about to die as a symbol.<br><br> Of God-only-knew-what.<br><br> A block away, Angus MacDonald got off the M4 bus, straight into the chilly puddle that snaked around the corner of Fifty-second Street and Fifth Avenue. Aware of the rain leaking into his supposedly waterproof trench coat, he made a run for it.<br><br> At least, he tried to. Thanks to the arthritis in his joints, sometimes his legs just refused to get with the program. Whoever had coined mind over matter obviously hadn&#x2019;t hit seventy-four.<br><br> Ahead of him, Angus saw virtually nothing. Only a traffic light that creaked and groaned as it swayed. This wasn&#x2019;t just Midtown at its quietest. The weather had made it a ghost town.<br><br> Then a man wearing an NYPD rubber raincoat emerged from the fog. Angus watched him cross Fifth Avenue in the middle of the block. Racing for the Cathedral. Not wanting to be late for seven-o&#x2019;clock Mass.<br><br> It was a reminder that Angus had better move faster&#x2014;or he was going to be late, too. He cut a forty-five-degree angle. Crossed the avenue.<br><br> The cop made it halfway up the stairs of Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral. Stopped.<br><br> There was a woman there. Just standing. Her canary-yellow raincoat stood out, even with the elaborate scaffolding that covered the entrance. Angus squinted. She was at least in her mid-twenties, he decided. She looked scared. So tense she didn&#x2019;t even respond to the cop staring at her. Like he wasn&#x2019;t even there.<br><br> She just stayed frozen in place, looking around.<br><br> The cop looked around, too.<br><br> There was nothing&#x2014;and no one&#x2014;to see. Only rain and fog and mist and the occasional headlights of a passing cab. And, of course, Angus.<br><br> The cop broke away with a shake of his head&#x2014;as if there was nothing he could do. Then he turned and walked into the Cathedral.<br><br> The cop had been a big guy with a ruddy face, maybe six-one, maybe two-fifty. More suited to taking out street thugs than talking down distraught women.<br><br> Angus resigned himself to being late to Mass. In his experience, young women loved creating drama. He could see his niece pulling a stunt like this: standing in the rain with some silly sign, just to prove a point or get attention after a breakup gone bad.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, lady&#x2014;why don&#x2019;t you come in out of the rain?&#x201d; he called when he was within earshot.<br><br> She was so startled she whirled and faced him.<br><br> She&#x2019;d obviously been lost in her own world, because Angus wasn&#x2019;t the type to scare people. With his wrinkled black skin, crinkled gray hair, and generous beer belly, he&#x2019;d even pass for Santa Claus, given an appropriate red suit.<br><br> He reached out a hand to help her&#x2014;but let it drop when she didn&#x2019;t move. Since the scaffolding provided scant shelter, he moved toward the massive bronze doors, shaking the worst of the water off his coat like a wet dog.<br><br> She stayed rooted in place, but she angled her head to watch him.<br><br> &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Angus. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d; He bunched his hands in the pockets of his coat, huddling against the downpour.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t reply, although she continued to look at him with an intense stare. Like she wanted to say something, but couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br> &#x201c;Just tell me your name. That&#x2019;s not so hard, right?&#x201d;<br><br> A whoosh of wind pushed away her bright yellow hood. Her hair blew wildly, and was instantly soaked, but she made no move to cover herself.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll catch your death out here,&#x201d; Angus scolded. &#x201c;Come inside with me.&#x201d;<br><br> Again, she didn&#x2019;t answer. She cocked her head, like she was trying to listen to something. But the only sound came from the driving rain as it pounded the marble steps.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for Mass,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Whatever&#x2019;s wrong, whatever&#x2019;s upset you, let&#x2019;s talk about it inside, where it&#x2019;s warm and dry.&#x201d;<br><br> She looked up, eyes searching the levels of scaffolding.<br><br> &#x201c;Your sign says help,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you. Let&#x2019;s go inside together.&#x201d;<br><br> She tried to raise her arms. It was a futile gesture. For the first time, Angus noticed: The sign she held was bound to her hands with tightly wrapped wire.<br><br> A troublesome sensation settled in his gut. No way did she do that to herself.<br><br> High above the Fifth Avenue skyscrapers, there was a flash of light, followed by a booming sound. Something in the atmosphere changed.<br><br> He needed to get help. He needed that cop. The giant bronze doors had just been open. He reached for the door on his right&#x2014;the one with Mother Elizabeth Seton&#x2014;and tugged.<br><br> It didn&#x2019;t budge. Not even when he pulled harder.<br><br> He tried again with the door on his left&#x2014;the one with the Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha&#x2014;and failed. He&#x2019;d have to try one of the side entrances.<br><br> But these doors shouldn&#x2019;t be locked. Not right before seven-o&#x2019;clock Mass. Not when he had just seen the cop go inside. Something was wrong.<br><br> Angus forced himself to think straight. Whoever had done this to the woman must be inside the Cathedral. But it would be all right. The cop was a big guy. Surely a big cop could handle whatever threat lurked inside. Angus should focus on the situation out here.<br><br> He turned back to the woman, who was now facing him.<br><br> Her eyes fixed on Angus&#x2019;s.<br><br> He was trying to decipher the mute plea in them when he noticed a funny red dot dancing on her forehead. It looked just like the laser pointer he used when he taught algebra class.<br><br> Then she was gone.<br><br> The shot was silent as it sliced through her forehead. She crumpled, and suddenly there was slick blood everywhere, mingling with the rain that puddled on the Cathedral steps.<br><br> Angus felt a terrible stinging in his head, though he knew he hadn&#x2019;t been hit.<br><br> His legs stopped working and he fell to his knees, collapsing beside her.<br><br> The sacrifice of His body and blood, Angus thought, fumbling for his cellphone. Words from the Mass service that he was missing.&nbsp;<br><br> The rain-swept morning was hushed and still. The streets remained deserted.<br><br> Hands shaking, Angus managed to call 911.<br><br> It was another seven minutes before help arrived for the dead woman with the wire-bound hands, still gripping her small wooden sign.<br><br> It would be another nine before the responding officer would notice something else. That the sign she had carried held a message.<br><br> Not the public plea for help that she had shown the world. There was a note&#x2014;a private communication taped on the back of the sign.<br><br> The officer didn&#x2019;t understand it.<br><br> But he was smart enough to radio it in.</p><h2>The Way the World works</h2><p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the book which helped launch the current economic miracle, Gateway Books is proudly repackaging and re-releasing The Way the World Works.

He reveals explosive stories, from the secret history of Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy to how the military plotted to undermine Barack Obama's strategy in Afghanistan, to show how internal strife and deep civilian-military animus shapes America's policy abroad, often to the nation's detriment.<br>Drawing on three decades of high-profile interviews, both on and off the record, Perry yields sobering judgments on the tenures of our nation's most important military leaders. <i>The Pentagon's Wars</i> is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the inner workings of the making of America's foreign policy.<br></p><p><b><br></b><b>Mark Perry</b> is a military and foreign affairs analyst whose articles have appeared in the<i> Nation</i>, <i>Foreign Policy</i>,<i> Washington Post</i>, and <i>Politico</i>.

Sometimes, he says, while he&#x2019;s drawing pictures of the birds, they draw <br>pictures of him. And sometimes they help him out by finding their own names in his bird book. "Birds are amazing," says Granddad, but Jess isn&#x2019;t so sure. So one day she goes birdwatching with Granddad to see for herself. <br><br>With expressive line-and-wash drawings, Simon James captures the leafy grandeur of the outdoors and the warm, special rapport between a child and a granddad, illustrating once again the huge happiness to be found in little things.</p><p>Things happen when Jess's granddad goes bird watching. Sometimes, when he makes drawings of the birds, they make drawings of him, too. And when he can't find their names in the bird book, his obliging feathered friends help him out. Well, at least this is the story Granddad tells Jess. Intrigued, she just has to find out for herself. The first thing Jess notices when they arrive in the woods is... nothing. Not a bird in sight, even when she uses Granddad's binoculars. But by day's end, Jess has seen plenty of birds--including a pair of dancing penguins who share her sandwich.<p> Simon James's (<i>Dear Mr. Blueberry</i>, <i>Leon and Bob</i>, etc.) dry comic timing is simply flawless in this warm, thoroughly appealing picture book.

Gutjahr's book is especially powerful in demonstrating how nineteenth-century efforts to purge the Bible of textual and translational impurities in search of an 'authentic' text led ironically to the emergence of entirely new gospels like the <i>Book of Mormon</i> and the massive fictionalized literature dealing with the life of Christ."</p><br><p>&#x2015;Jay Fliegelman,</p><br><p>Stanford University</p><br><br><p>During the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, American publishing experienced unprecedented, exponential growth. An emerging market economy, widespread religious revival, educational reforms, and innovations in print technology worked together to create a culture increasingly formed and framed by the power of print. At the center of this new culture was the Bible, the book that has been called "<i>the</i> best seller" in American publishing history. Yet it is important to realize that the Bible in America was not a simple, uniform entity. First printed in the United States during the American Revolution, the Bible underwent many revisions, translations, and changes in format as different editors and publishers appropriated it to meet a wide range of changing ideological and economic demands.</p><br><p>This book examines how many different constituencies (both secular and religious) fought to keep the Bible the preeminent text in the United States as the country's print marketplace experienced explosive growth. The author shows how these heated battles had profound consequences for many American cultural practices and forms of printed material. By exploring how publishers, clergymen, politicians, educators, and lay persons met the threat that new printed material posed to the dominance of the Bible by changing both its form and its contents, the author reveals the causes and consequences of mutating God's supposedly immutable Word.</p></p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating journey through the history of the Bible in America, unprecedented in its scope, erudition, and imagination.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jon Butler, Yale University<br>&#x201c;This pathbreaking study of the production of Bibles in the early history of the United States is a splendid effort in every way.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark A.

Just six months before their wedding, the only people who had heard of Wallis Simpson were those people who belonged to the tiny social circle surrounding the royal family. Press coverage and newsreels were strictly censored. Through contemporary letters and diaries, many never before published, Susan Williams demonstrates the huge popularity of the King and the events that led to his downfall.<br></p><p><b>Susan Williams</b> is a historian at the University of London.<br>"Royal watchers will perhaps be startled by details of the relationship between the royal family and the state."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Back in January this year the Public Record Office released hundreds of files relating to the Abdication Crisis of 1936, and the historical advisor to this important event was the University of London historian Susan Williams. Having been there, I can attest to her diligence and scholarship on that occasion, and this book is based on the work she has done on that vast labyrinth of documentation....Just as after Diana's death huge numbers of people wrote to express their sympathy and support, so Edward VIII was deluged during the Abdication Crisis, and Susan Williams has trawled her way through thousands of the letters to extrapolate common themes. She suggests that ordinary people in Britain and the Empire were quite ready for Wallis Simpson to be Queen. Huge numbers of people, she argues, simply wanted the King to be happy." - Andrew Roberts in<i> The Telegraph </i><br><br>"The tale of the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 has been told many times, but Susan Williams brings to bear two new sources of information that cast the familiar saga in a new light...What she undeniably succeeds in doing is illustrating better than most previous accounts of this crisis just how the public-Edward's subjects - felt about the pressure he was put under to abdicate. To achieve this she has been to record offices and consulted private diaries, as well as reading that pile of letters at Windsor." - <i>Country Life</i><br><br>"This book is an exercise in rehabilitation. As such it is overdue. The Duke of Windsor has been spectacularly traduced in recent years...without even the courtesy of a question mark.

The words are geared for gently coaxing little ones to sleep: "Who knows where you'll fly away,/ winging past the light of day?/ The man in the moon and the Milky Way/ welcome you to dreamland." Catering to the same pearly taste, Noonan's (Emma &amp; Mommy Talk to God) oil paintings have the retro flavor of tinted photographs of the '30s and '40s. A cherubic blonde girl drifts off to sleep, floating across a pastel night sky with multiracial companions who emerge from blossoming flowers and who snuggle with stuffed animals?it seems almost unnecessary to add that the stars and the moon all wear smiling faces.

Patterson arrived in East Africa with a mission to build a railway bridge over the Tsavo River. Over the course of several weeks Patterson and his mostly Indian workforce were systematically hunted by two man-eating lions . In all, 100 workers were killed, and the entire bridge-building project was delayed. As well as being stalked by lions, Patterson had to guard his back against his own increasingly hostile and mutinous workers as he set out to track and kill the man-eaters. <br>Patterson's account of the lions' reign of terror and his own attempts to kill them is the stuff of great adventure. Consider this description of the aftermath of an attack by the lions: "...we at once set out to follow the brutes, Mr. Dalgairns feeling confident that he had wounded one of them, as there was a trail on the sand like that of the toes of a broken limb.... we saw in the gloom what we at first took to be a lion cub; closer inspection, however, showed it to be the remains of the unfortunate coolie, which the man-eaters had evidently abandoned at our approach. The legs, one arm and half the body had been eaten, and it was the stiff fingers of the other arm trailing along the sand which had left the marks we had taken to be the trail of a wounded lion...." This classic tale of death, courage, and terror in the African bush is still a page-turner, even after all these years. <br></p><p>In 1898 John H. Patterson arrived in East Africa with a mission to build a railway bridge over the Tsavo River. What started out as a simple engineering problem, however, soon took on almost mythical proportions as Patterson and his mostly Indian workforce were systematically hunted by two man-eating lions over the course of several weeks. During that time, 100 workers were killed, and the entire bridge-building project ground to a halt. As if the lions weren't enough, Patterson had to guard his back against his own increasingly hostile and mutinous workers as he set out to track and kill the man-eaters. This larger-than-life tale forms the basis of the entertaining film <i>The Ghost and the Darkness</i>, but for readers who want to know the whole--and true--story, <i>The Man-Eaters of Tsavo</i> comes straight from the great white-hunter's mouth.<p> Patterson's account of the lions' reign of terror and his own subsequent attempts to kill them is the stuff of great adventure, and his unmistakably Victorian manner of telling it only adds to the thrill. Consider this description of the aftermath of an attack by the lions: "...we at once set out to follow the brutes, Mr. Dalgairns feeling confident that he had wounded one of them, as there was a trail on the sand like that of the toes of a broken limb.... we saw in the gloom what we at first took to be a lion cub; closer inspection, however, showed it to be the remains of the unfortunate coolie, which the man-eaters had evidently abandoned at our approach. The legs, one arm and half the body had been eaten, and it was the stiff fingers of the other arm trailing along the sand which had left the marks we had taken to be the trail of a wounded lion...." This classic tale of death, courage, and terror in the African bush is still a page-turner, even after all these years.</p>Originally published in 1907, this book records the harrowing true story of what really happened at Tsavo in 1898. If you are interested in the Tsavo Maneaters, this book is a must read! One of the first works on the subject of man-eating lions by someone with first-hand experience, it details a series of attacks on the Indian workers building the Mombasa to Uganda railway in 1898&#x2013;1899. It was Patterson's task to rid the project of some man-eaters who had decimated the missing, but the discovery of the bodies soon dispelled that notion. Over the next few months, the lions had their pick of the workers along the railway line, and various traps and vigils all failed to work, until one of the lions was shot by Patterson, who had waited all night at the top of a 12 feet-high structure of sticks for the opportunity. The second male was shot soon after, but between them these two lions had accounted for over 100 workers and natives, "of whom no official record was kept."<br>After killing the infamous lions, Colonel Patterson had their skins made into rugs and they resided in his home in England after his return from East Africa. In 1907, he wrote "The Man Eaters of Tsavo", which was a hit, and is considered today to be a literary classic. It is still to this day the most extraordinary account of man-eating animals ever recorded!<br></p><h2>Digital Communications</h2><p>The text is flexible and can easily be used in a one semester course or there is enough depth to cover two semesters.

It was nine thirty in the morning, a half hour after Prescott&#x2019;s: Antiques and Auctions&#x2019; regular start time, and my assistant wasn&#x2019;t there. Gretchen, who was supposed to be back to work yesterday after a two-week Hawaiian vacation, and who, in four years, had never once been tardy, hadn&#x2019;t shown up or even called. I was worried sick. <p></p><p></p>I thought again of the man, the stranger, who&#x2019;d been trying to reach her. He&#x2019;d called frequently while she was out of town, wouldn&#x2019;t leave a message, and had seemed increasingly frustrated that we wouldn&#x2019;t reveal details of her schedule. It was company policy that we never gave out specific information about anyone on staff, but he took it as a personal affront. <p></p><p></p>"Has anyone spoken to that guy lately?" I asked. "You know, the one calling for Gretchen?" <p></p><p></p>"I did. Tuesday," Fred said, pushing up his square, black- framed glasses. Fred was an antiques appraiser who&#x2019;d joined my firm a couple of years back, moving from New York City to New Hampshire. He was a terrific find&#x2014;he had a keen eye and an educated sensibility. <p></p><p></p>"How did he sound?" I asked. <p></p><p></p>"Pissed off. He got sarcastic when I told him she wasn&#x2019;t available and offered to take a message. He asked if we kept her chained in the back." <p></p><p></p>"Wow. That&#x2019;s pretty intense." <p></p><p></p>Yesterday, I&#x2019;d managed to contain my anxiety enough to limit myself to one cheerfully worded, "Welcome home, are you okay?" <p></p><p></p>voice mail message. Today, I needed to do something else, something more, but I didn&#x2019;t know what, and then I thought of Gretchen&#x2019;s friend Mandy Tollerson. <p></p><p></p>I&#x2019;d first met Mandy about four months ago when Gretchen had solicited my help on her behalf. According to Gretchen, Mandy&#x2019;s boyfriend, Vince Collins, was a complete creep, and she was encouraging Mandy to break away. When Mandy had confided to Gretchen that she dreamed of starting her own business, an art gallery, Gretchen had brought her to me, hoping that I&#x2019;d fire her up to act, and that somehow being independent in business would make her independent in her romantic relationship, too. Since then, Mandy had stopped by every few weeks with some business questions. Last week, she&#x2019;d asked about tracking sales and expenses, and I&#x2019;d taught her how to calculate break- even. <p></p><p></p>I dialed her home phone number. A machine picked up after four rings. "Hi, Mandy. It&#x2019;s Josie. Josie Prescott. Would you give me a call, please?" I asked, adding my phone number. It was too early to call her at her job&#x2014;she was an assistant manager at the Bow Street Emporium, a high- end gift shop in Portsmouth&#x2014;and I didn&#x2019;t have her cell phone number. A dead end. <p></p><p></p>I turned to Sasha, my chief appraiser. "If you wanted to call someone who knows Gretchen, to see if they&#x2019;ve heard from her, who would it be?" <p></p><p></p>She tilted her head as she considered my question, her intelligence apparent in her thoughtful expression. Her fine, shoulder-length brown hair hung straight to her shoulders. "She mentioned that a friend was watering her plants while she was gone, but I don&#x2019;t know who." <p></p><p></p>I asked the same question of Fred and Eric, my back room supervisor, and got the same answer. I wasn&#x2019;t surprised. None of us knew much about Gretchen. From the day she&#x2019;d showed up on my doorstep, promising to work hard and help my business grow, until the day she&#x2019;d left for vacation, she&#x2019;d shared almost nothing about herself. Not long after she started, Sasha had asked her if she was traveling over the holidays to visit family, and she&#x2019;d given a vague, peppy response. "Home is where the heart is," she&#x2019;d said. <p></p><p></p>I didn&#x2019;t even know if Gretchen had family. She was inexorably cheerful, physically beautiful, and quick to learn and adapt. She loved celebrity gossip, but about herself she was relentlessly private. I had no idea where she came from or what she did in her free time. <p></p><p></p>Trying to figure out what to do, I unlocked the file cabinet where I stored employee personnel files. On Gretchen&#x2019;s, the line for an emergency contact was blank. I&#x2019;d never noticed that before. I located her condo contact information and called the property manager. Meryl, an associate in the office, listened to my explanation, then put me on hold while she asked for and received permission from her boss to allow me to enter Gretchen&#x2019;s unit. She agreed to meet me there right away with the key. <p></p><p></p>I told Sasha where I was going. <p></p><p></p>"Please call as soon as you know something," she requested. <p></p><p></p>I said I would, and as I spoke, I saw my apprehension reflected in her eyes. We shared the unspoken fear that something was very, very wrong. <p></p><p></p>I beat Meryl to the Pond View condo complex, where Gretchen owned unit eight, and while I waited for her to arrive, I knocked on Gretchen&#x2019;s door. Nothing. From my perch on the second- floor balcony, I noticed three cars in the lot, not counting mine, and Gretchen&#x2019;s wasn&#x2019;t one of them. An old Chevy with Tennessee plates was parked closest to Gretchen&#x2019;s front door. A Ford SUV and a Toyota sat on the other side of the lot. <p></p><p></p>A steady stream of traffic noise rose from the street. I heard a complaining caw, caw from the pond barely visible through a passageway between two buildings. A red minivan turned into the parking lot, parking near the Chevy. <p></p><p></p>A stocky woman of about forty stepped out of the van. She brushed unruly auburn hair out of her eyes as she scanned the area. <p></p><p></p>"Meryl?" I called. <p></p><p></p>"Josie?" she asked, squinting into the sun. <p></p><p></p>She saw me waving. "Have you knocked?" she asked when she joined me. "Yeah. A couple of times." "Just in case," she said. She banged the clapper, stared at the <p></p><p></p>ground for a count of fifteen, then clapped again. After another ten <p></p><p></p>seconds&#x2019; wait, she looked up. I met her anxious gaze and shrugged. "Let&#x2019;s do it," I said. Meryl opened the door and shouted Gretchen&#x2019;s name before <p></p><p></p>crossing the threshold. There was no reply. We walked inside. The apartment felt very still. Something smelled bad, like rotten eggs, except worse. I heard a hum&#x2014;a low- pitched, soft, machine sound. The refrigerator, I thought, glancing into the empty kitchen. Shoulder to shoulder, Meryl and I edged down a short carpeted hall. Meryl stepped into the living area, stopped short, and screamed. <p></p><p></p>At the sound, my heart began to race, and my mouth went arid. She turned to me, her eyes wide open, shocked, and then she crossed herself. <p></p><p></p>My stomach leapt into my throat, then plummeted. I stepped around her to gain a better view. Sprawled on the sofa was a man&#x2014; dead&#x2014;shot. <p></p><p></p>Excerpted from Killer Keepsakes by Jane K. Cleland.Copyright � 2009 by Jane K.

Written with great wit and ingenuity, the series is presented as a succession of long-lost memoirs, which Fraser is simply editing for a modern readership. Thus does he interrupt Sir Harry's voice with footnotes, appendices, and tail-gunning apologies. Indeed, Fraser, whose editorial persona is humorless and academic, seems almost embarrassed in the presence of his subject's unbridled self-love.<p> This time the year is 1878, and Flashman is poking his nose into some deep political intrigue for a journalist friend who's done him various unsavory favors. Our favorite swashbuckler has just returned from Paris, where he was awarded the Legion of Honor. Yet readers familiar with Flashman's saga will know this is simply one more piece of tin to add to his capacious collection--and that even as he's revered by those around him, he finds it impossible to take himself seriously. Instead he regards himself as "one of those fortunate critters who ... are simply without shame, and wouldn't know Conscience if they tripped over it in broad day."</p><p> As usual, Flashman stumbles through history like a bull in a china shop. At the end of the first section, "The Road to Charing Cross," we realize that he's delayed the onset of World War I by various wranglings with the would-be assassins of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. The following sections put him in contact with the Prince of Wales, a procession of remarkable whores, Zulu warriors, and yet more remarkable whores. Fraser's brashly perfect prose both fuels and awakens the imagination. And in the end the reader has to wonder: which wars almost came to pass, but were averted by a half-drunk war hero with a lust for life? <i>--Emily White</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mike at Wrykyn</h2><p>This charming story of the Jackson cricketing dynasty describes the adventures of Mike Jackson at boarding school as he makes his way up the sporting ladder to the first eleven. The young P. G. Wodehouse evokes the peaceful, prosperous world of middle-class England before the Great War, a place where rich men hire private cricket professionals to coach their sons at home, and little seems to matter at school except the publishing of team lists and the taking of tea. But such is the novelist&#39;s skill that he can make excitement from the small-scale dramas of teenage life, and interest even the most unsporting reader in the cricket matches he describes so lovingly. A curiosity for those who know only the Wodehouse of &#34;Blandings&#34; and &#34;Piccadilly&#34;, but a delightful one.</p><p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.Released as a single volume in 1909, the first two of this trio follow the misadventures of young cricket ace Mike Jackson and his chum at school. Published a little later in Wodehouse's career (1928), Money for Nothing serves up a Romeo and Juliet-like tale of the romance between the offspring of two feuding buffoons.

From the bighearted American medic stalked by a sniper, a tough Iraqi major who is respected by the Americans because he likes them the least, and an enemy who blended into a population that dared not speak the truth, the characters in The Snake Eaters are as complex as the war that changes them.</p><p><b>Owen West</b> is a former Marine major who served two combat tours in Iraq. He is the author of two novels, including <i>Sharkman Six</i>, which won the Boyd literary award for best military novel, and his work has appeared in <i>Men&#x2019;s Journal</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,<i> </i>and numerous other publications.The Snake Eaters 1<p></p> <br>Into the Haze<br> <br><br> September 2005<p></p> <br>Hunched over the steering wheel of his Humvee, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Chris Watson, 26, cursed. His was the last of four vehicles in a tiny convoy headed into Khalidiya. Watson turned on the wipers to brush away the dust stirred by the heaving troop carrier barely visible ten meters ahead.<br> <br>Through the scratched Plexiglass of his bulletproof windshield, Watson could see a dozen Iraqi enlisted soldiers, called jundis, packed tightly against the troop carrier&#x2019;s sandbagged walls, their AK-47s swaying like cattails as the big vehicle heaved. Two jundis were perched dangerously on the tailgate. The Iraqi privates were either too junior to claim shelter against the leaking sandbags or too fatalistic to care if they lived, Insha&#x2019;Allah, to fight again tomorrow.<br> <br>It was September 16, 2005. Watson was part of a ten-man advisor team of Army reservists that had deployed to Iraq expecting to teach jundis basic training on a secure, sprawling base with a Burger King, a Green Bean coffee shop, and a fitness center. Their combat tour, they thought, would consist of posting cell phone videos of AK-47 shoots and barracks antics on YouTube. Instead, they were embedded in 3/3&#x2013;1&#x2014;the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Iraqi Army Division&#x2014;and ordered to remake themselves as infantry combat advisors in Khalidiya, living and fighting as Iraqi soldiers.<br> <br>The lead vehicle was a sputtering white Nissan truck carrying the Iraqi patrol commander and his bodyguards. Behind it were two armored troop carriers filled with jundis and driven by U.S. National Guardsmen stationed on Camp Habbaniyah. Last came Watson&#x2019;s Humvee, which was occupied by two fellow combat advisors. The convoy roared out of the barbed-wire gates of Camp Habbaniyah into &#x201c;Indian country,&#x201d; soldierspeak for enemy territory since the Dakota Wars of the 1860s when U.S. cavalrymen from isolated forts pursued indigenous tribes. Watson knew from the single predeployment class he&#x2019;d had on Iraqi religion that there were Sunni tribes in his area and that they hated the Shiites, but that was about it. He was more concerned with the awful road conditions. Death came three ways in Iraq: sniper shots, roadside bombs, and suicide car bombs, which were the most catastrophic.<br> <br>An Iraqi car swerved to the side of the road as the convoy bore down the highway. Watson could barely see it through the cloud of dust. For a moment he thought the shifting image was a car bomb, but then the troop truck full of jundis barreled right past the idling car and Watson followed tight in its contrail, squinting at the expressionless civilian driver while his own heart hammered.<br> <br>Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s Heart of Darkness, a cult favorite of Special Forces advisors, describes British gunboats, a century before, bombarding a dark green African jungle&#x2014;a metaphor for the gulf between two civilizations. In Iraq, the Humvee had replaced the gunboat. In the hot, dusty haze, Watson could barely see through the four inches of armored Plexiglas.<br> <br>In the Humvee, Sergeant Shawn Boiko, 24, could see better. Standing on the gunner&#x2019;s platform above Watson, his torso poked through the hole in the roof where the turret was mounted. A wet cotton T-shirt wrapped over his mouth, Boiko surveyed the bouncing pile of jundis over his 7.62mm machine gun. They were younger and skinnier than he expected, and it scared him. Everything about the mission did.<br> <br>On paper, Boiko was expected to &#x201c;advise&#x201d; the jundis on how to fight like U.S. soldiers. Like the rest of his teammates, he was only a part-time soldier&#x2014;a flooring manager from California. He figured that before he passed whatever soldiering skills he had on to the jundis, the first order of business was keeping his teammates alive.<br> <br>This was only his second trip into Khalidiya. On Boiko&#x2019;s previous journey, a handover ride with the outgoing advisors to give the newcomers an overview of their area of responsibility, they had heard the dull crump of a distant explosion, followed by high-pitched shouts over the radio. Advisors patrolling with a different Iraqi battalion two kilometers away yelled of casualties as they traded rounds with insurgents.<br> <br>One of the experienced advisors conducting the turnover had said, &#x201c;Khalidiya. Biggest city in the area. It&#x2019;s a very bad area. People hate our guts. Couple days and it&#x2019;s all yours. Can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;ll miss it.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time, Boiko was no longer a spectator. He grasped the hand wheel that swiveled the heavy machine gun, cranking like a yachtsman turning the winch on his sail. The wheel&#x2019;s teeth bit into the turret base ring, shifting the half-ton steel doughnut fluidly to let Boiko&#x2019;s barrel sweep over one car after the other as Iraqi drivers peeled off the road to let the three trucks of jundis and the Humvee pass.<br> <br>As the up-gunner, the Humvee&#x2019;s only defense, Boiko figured he had about two seconds to decide to open fire if one of the hundreds of erratic Iraqi motorists suddenly sped directly at the Humvee. He pointed the jiggling front sight post of his gun at one car, then another, and slightly depressed an imaginary trigger finger for the fifth&#x2014;or was it the fiftieth?&#x2014;time.<br> <br>The convoy was on Route Michigan, the most heavily mined road in Iraq, averaging a dozen firefights and twenty roadside bombs every day between Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, and Fallujah. On the route-planning maps it was labeled &#x201c;black,&#x201d; or closed to logistics convoys, but not to combat patrols like Boiko&#x2019;s. Anbar itself, which is larger than North Carolina, was held by just twenty-two thousand U.S. soldiers and Marines dispersed over twenty thousand square kilometers. That was just 20 percent of the total U.S. force in Iraq, yet Anbar was responsible for almost half the American deaths in the entire country.<br> <br>Boiko didn&#x2019;t know the statistics. He just sensed that Khalidiya, which was halfway between Ramadi and Fallujah, was bad news because of the local vibe. Vehicle patrols were Iraq&#x2019;s version of safari. Boiko and his fellow advisors had been told to memorize the web of roadways into Khalidiya, but it was hard to keep his eyes off the people loitering along Route Michigan, the mustached men in dirty knockoff designer sweat suits and the women hidden inside abayas who scurried nervously into doorways as the convoy passed. There was an air of impending doom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let some jackass crash into us,&#x201d; Chris Watson shouted.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say &#x2018;watch for IEDs,&#x2019; but I doubt it&#x2019;d do any good,&#x201d; Sergeant First Class Mark Huss, 36, yelled up to Boiko over the engine roar.<br> <br>As the senior advisor on the patrol, Huss sat in the right-hand seat next to Watson. Looking out the blast window, he was horrified by the mounds of trash that hemmed them in on both sides. They had been told by a stateside trainer to look for anything out of the ordinary, but there was enough garbage littering the macadam to conceal a hundred bombs. Besides, everything here was &#x201c;out of the ordinary.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If they want to hit us,&#x201d; said Huss, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s not much we can do about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Except react. But the three rookie advisors did not know how they would react under fire. They hadn&#x2019;t experienced combat, and they were not infantrymen, or even regular soldiers. Watson was a cop from Virginia. Huss ran a plumbing company in Iowa. Since being activated, Watson and Boiko were his new direct reports. With the team&#x2019;s other seven teammates back in Camp Habbaniyah&#x2014;including his team leader, Lieutenant Colonel Mike Troster, a DEA agent&#x2014;Huss felt a crushing weight of responsibility. He vowed never again to be stressed by a call about a burst pipe.<br> <br><br> <br>By the fall of 2005, reservists like Mark Huss had become, haphazardly, the main effort in America&#x2019;s exit from Iraq. President George W. Bush had explained the strategy earlier that year in an address to the nation, saying, &#x201c;As the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.&#x201d;1 The New Iraqi Army was being built from scratch, so that they could take over control of the country, but the &#x201c;new&#x201d; jundis were mostly poor volunteer recruits with little military experience, and the officers&#x2014;many of whom had served in the &#x201c;old&#x201d; Iraqi army under Saddam&#x2014;had neither the experience to lead troops in the absence of ruthless conscription nor a plan to break the insurgency in their own country.<br> <br>Hundreds of Iraqi units in various stages of development needed to be mentored by U.S. advisor teams. Many Iraqi units were still in training and required basic classes that mimicked American boot camp. A few, like 3/3&#x2013;1&#x2014;one of the first New Iraqi Army battalions&#x2014;were in the fight and needed experienced combat advisors to show them how to defeat insurgents firsthand and link them to U.S. medical and fire support.<br> <br>The U.S. military had few trained advisors. Although the Army&#x2019;s traditional counterinsurgency instructors, the Special Forces, took great pains to select and train advisors in three-year training blocks, many of their teams had been assigned to raiding units designed to kill or capture high-level insurgents. Even if they were reassigned, the Special Forces had enough teams to fill only 10 percent of the billets. Conventional active-duty infantry commanders, in turn, desperately avoided the mad scramble to embed small groups of Americans in fledgling Iraqi units. They didn&#x2019;t want to break their units into autonomous parts, effectively ceding control of their men to Iraqi colonels. So the advisor mission fell to reservists.<br> <br>Confusion over the mission pervaded the highest ranks of the U.S. military. Advising was considered basic training in garrison instead of building counterinsurgency skills in combat. The Army handed the advisor assignment to its two reserve institutional training divisions, the 98th and the 80th, which specialized in classroom education and static training. Neither unit had deployed since World War II, and even then the 98th saw no combat. Selection for advisor duty was not rigorous. Soldiers could not be overtly prejudiced, handicapped, or too fat to deploy. Infantry training was not required, and combat experience was scant among the seven hundred reservists in each division. The soldiers in the 98th were given forty-two days of stateside &#x201c;advisor training,&#x201d; where they drilled for a tour training jundis on a giant forward operating base (FOB), a theme that reflected the confusion at the top.<br> <br>The 98th was the first division to ship out, in the fall of 2004. The advisors posted to Iraqi Battalion 3/3&#x2013;1 included a lumberjack, a T-shirt salesman, and a trombone player in the U.S. Army band. They soon found themselves in combat. After graduating from training in December 2004, Iraqi Battalion 3/3&#x2013;1 was ordered into Mosul, north of Baghdad, to fight alongside an American motorized infantry battalion. The advisors went wherever their host unit went. They were classroom instructors no more. The ten-man team was expected not only to teach the fledgling Iraqi battalion how to defeat insurgents, from the jundis all the way up to the commanding officer, but also to manage the relationships their prot�g�s formed with nearby U.S. units and even local sheikhs. It was widely considered the trickiest job in Iraq.<br> <br>Because of the flawed selection process and the brief, misguided training program, performance of the advisors was uneven. Many teams failed to adequately progress their Iraqi units. Complaints about the underprepared reservists stretched from the battlefield to the high command in Baghdad, where one colonel threatened to write a book titled Blame It on the 98th.2 The general in charge of the military advisors, a former Special Forces commander, doubted the reservists had the requisite skills for advising.3 Even the senior U.S. commander in the Middle East, General John Abizaid, criticized the decision to assign the advising mission to reservists. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t give you the best and the brightest,&#x201d; he told Lieutenant General David Petraeus, who in the summer of 2004 had been brought in to run the entire Iraqi security rebuild. &#x201c;We put the third team on the field.&#x201d;4<br> <br>Huss&#x2019;s 80th Institutional Training Division replaced the 98th in September 2005. Recipients of the same misguided training that had plagued the 98th a year earlier, Huss&#x2019;s ten-man team had two additional obstacles to overcome upon being assigned to Iraqi Battalion 3/3&#x2013;1: The Iraqi unit had six months of combat experience and required tactical advice that was a step above other Iraqi units emerging from training, and they were stationed in Anbar Province, which meant tough combat and interservice friction. Anbar was sometimes called &#x201c;Marineland&#x201d; because it was run by Marines. There were only two other Army advisor teams in the entire province, the vast majority being Marine teams. Several members of the original advisor team from the 98th assigned to 3/3&#x2013;1 in 2004 had been forcibly replaced, including the team leader, an Army major, who had been replaced by a Marine captain.<br> <br>When Huss&#x2019;s team reported to Camp Habbaniyah in September 2005, their Marine bosses tried to comfort them by saying they didn&#x2019;t need to reinvent the wheel. They just had to &#x201c;keep up the mentorship,&#x201d; a senior advisor told them, and &#x201c;unfuck the Iraqis.&#x201d; What that meant exactly, the rookie advisors did not know. They were average Americans handed an extraordinary mission. Somehow they had to build confidence and competence in the Iraqis to take the lead in the war, and ultimately defeat the insurgency, so the Americans could leave. With little understanding of the situation, no doctrine or training on advising to lean on, and zero combat experience to provide rules for staying alive, the rookie advisor team had been shoved into the dragon&#x2019;s mouth.<br> <br>Lieutenant Colonel Troster, the advisor team leader, hoped to lean on the nearby U.S. &#x201c;partner unit.&#x201d; The plan to have the Iraqi security forces take over the war was not limited to advisors. Each Iraqi battalion was partnered with a conventional American battalion for logistics and medevac support, and to operate alongside in combat until they were ready for independence. This way the jundis could mimic regular U.S. infantrymen on patrol as well as their few advisors, and the advisors could supervise the relationship between the units and reinforce the salient day-to-day lessons.<br> <br>In Habbaniyah, 3/3&#x2013;1&#x2019;s partner unit was an ad hoc U.S. National Guard task force called Task Force Panther, built around the 1&#x2013;110th National Guard infantry battalion from Pennsylvania. TF Panther had arrived in Iraq two months earlier, in July 2005, as a mishmash of National Guard units that included tanks from Vermont, artillery from Utah, infantry from Michigan and Pennsylvania, and dozens of individual augmentees from across the United States. Panther deployed with only three undersize infantry companies in part because many of the guardsmen balked at the original activation order. Only a handful of guardsmen had been activated during a decade of war in Vietnam. Few expected to be called to fight in Iraq after just two years of war.<br> <br>Troster, Huss, and the rest of the 3/3&#x2013;1 advisors were, in turn, surprised that their Iraqi battalion was partnered with...</p><h2>The Corpse Had a Familiar Face: Covering Miami, America&#39;s Hottest Beat</h2><p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning police reporter recalls her eighteen years covering the police beat for The Miami Herald and describes the city, its diverse people, its underworld, and the diverse criminals and cases she encountered during her career.

Extensively illustrated, it treats the history of art &#x2014; both chronologically and geographically &#x2014; as a continuous unfolding story. Offers a vivid, enthusiastic, and interpretive narrative written in direct, straightforward language &#x2014; with technical terms always explained when they are introduced. <b>KEY TOPICS:</b> Focuses on the most significant works of Western art. Considers each work of art in its context: shows how art reflects the historical setting, the artist's intentions, and the values of that civilization, and how each artist built upon, or sometimes reacted against, the style of his/her predecessors. Contains chronological charts, maps, and notes on art books. Illustrates all works that are discussed. Features a new design&#x2014;with each illustration appearing on the same spread as the narrative that discusses it.</p><p>The Story of Art is one of the most famous and popular books on art ever published. For 45 years it has remained unrivalled as an introduction to the whole subject, from the earliest cave paintings to the experimental art of today. Readers of all ages and backgrounds throughout the world have found in Professor Gombrich a true master, who combines knowledge and wisdom with a unique gift for communicating directly his own deep love of the works of art he describes. The Story of Art owes its lasting popularity to the directness and simplicity of the writing, and also the author&#39;s skill in presenting a clear narrative. He describes his aim as &#39;to bring some intelligible order into the wealth of names, periods and styles which crowd the pages of more ambitious works&#39;, and using his insight into the psychology of the visual arts, he makes us see the history of art as &#39;a continuous weaving and changing of traditions in which each work refers to the past and points to the future&#39;, &#39;a living chain that still links our own time with the Pyramid age&#39;. In its new format, the 16th edition of this classic work is set to continue its triumphant progress for future generations and to remain the first choice for all newcomers to art.Ernst Gombrich was one of the greatest and least conventional art historians of his age, achieving fame and distinction in three separate spheres: as a scholar, as a popularizer of art, and as a pioneer of the application of the psychology of perception to the study of art. His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews.Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.</p><h2>Whit</h2><p>A little knowledge can be a very dangerous thing...

Each experiment is designed to answer a specific question which is clearly answered by following correct scientific procedure. All materials used can (truly) be purchased at a grocery store. Procedure for each experiment is fully explained in the text. Procedures calling for adult assistance are used five times; however, students needing help passing a weak electric current through solution may not need help slicing an apple or turning on an oven. Close observation is required to answer the questions asked about each experiment. Complete explanations of observations and results are followed by specific suggestions for modification of each experiment to further understanding of the principle being studied. These are simple experiments, accessible to even reluctant or intimidated science students. This book is similar in scope and content to Robert Gardner's Kitchen Chemistry (Messner, 1982). Although Kitchen Chemistry has projects more complex and varied, the format of Adventures with Atoms and Molecules makes its experiments easier to read and follow. What this book lacks is excitement; if that is supplied by other students or adults, the book will be an excellent resource for at-home or in-school investigations. Dull, unimaginative computer-generated diagrams belie the integrity of the text.

Can freezing temperatures harm plants? The fifth volume in this hands-on Adventures with Science series contains 30 experiments that demonstrate basic chemistry principles. For each experiment there's a list of materials, an outline of procedures, questions about observations, detailed discussion of the results, and suggestions for other things to try. Where necessary, there are strong safety directives about asking an adult for help. The book looks like a basic user's guide with small type, clear subheads, and occasional black-and-white illustrations. The writing style is plain and direct, just right for the stated purpose of making young people do, observe, and think science. There are lots of starters here for science fair projects. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The Case for the Real Jesus: A Journalist Investigates Current Attacks on the Identity of Christ</h2><p><p>Has modern scholarship debunked the traditional Christ? Has the church suppressed the truth about Jesus to advance its own agenda? What if the real Jesus is far different from the atoning Savior worshipped through the centuries? In The Case for the Real Jesus, former award-winning legal editor Lee Strobel explores such hot-button questions as: � Did the church suppress ancient non-biblical documents that paint a more accurate picture of Jesus than the four Gospels? � Did the church distort the truth about Jesus by tampering with early New Testament texts? � Do new insights and explanations finally disprove the resurrection? � Have fresh arguments disqualified Jesus from being the Messiah? � Did Christianity steal its core ideas from earlier mythology?

Visit Lee's website at: leestrobel.com</p>Atheist-turned-Christian Strobel, with four Gold Medallions and other awards, focuses on rediscovering the real Jesus, whose identity and message have come under attack in recent years. He addresses six major challenges and claims: that a different Jesus is seen in ancient documents that seem as credible as the four canonical gospels; that tampering by the church has damaged the Bible's portrayal of Jesus; that new explanations refute Jesus' resurrection; that Christianity copied pagan religions regarding Jesus; that Jesus didn't fulfill messianic prophecies; and that contemporary people should be able to choose what to believe about Jesus. As with his previous books, Strobel attacks the issues as an investigative journalist, though one with a clear agenda. He searches out experts (including Craig A. Evans and Michael Licona) to refute each objection, offering readers top evangelical scholarship revealed in everyday language while challenging the claims of liberal writers like John Shelby Spong, Bart Ehrman and others. In the end, he says, none of these seemingly daunting challenges turned out to be close calls... they were systematically dismantled by scholars... with facts, logic and evidence. Evangelical readers will come away with deeper understanding of the various arguments about Jesus. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In their perplexity many deep-thinking people sought the advice of Marsilio Ficino, the leader of the Platonic Academy in Florence, and through his letters he advised them, encouraged them, and sometimes reproved them. Ficino was utterly fearless in expressing what he knew to be true. His letters cover the widest range of topics, mixing philosophy and humor, compassion and advice, and offering a profound glimpse into the soul of the Renaissance.<br><br>This is the only accessible collection of Ficino's writings available in English.</p><p>Clement Salaman is the editor of the English translation of <i>The Letters of Marsilio Ficino</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Nursery Rhyme Pup Tr</h2><p>Cute board book for young children.</p><p></p><h2>The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times.</h2><p><p>Griffins, Centaurs, Cyclopes, and Giants--these fabulous creatures of classical mythology continue to live in the modern imagination through the vivid accounts that have come down to us from the ancient Greeks and Romans. But what if these beings were more than merely fictions? What if monstrous creatures once roamed the earth in the very places where their legends first arose? This is the arresting and original thesis that Adrienne Mayor explores in <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i>. Through careful research and meticulous documentation, she convincingly shows that many of the giants and monsters of myth did have a basis in fact--in the enormous bones of long-extinct species that were once abundant in the lands of the Greeks and Romans.</p><br><p>As Mayor shows, the Greeks and Romans were well aware that a different breed of creatures once inhabited their lands. They frequently encountered the fossilized bones of these primeval beings, and they developed sophisticated concepts to explain the fossil evidence, concepts that were expressed in mythological stories. The legend of the gold-guarding griffin, for example, sprang from tales first told by Scythian gold-miners, who, passing through the Gobi Desert at the foot of the Altai Mountains, encountered the skeletons of Protoceratops and other dinosaurs that littered the ground.</p><br><p>Like their modern counterparts, the ancient fossil hunters collected and measured impressive petrified remains and displayed them in temples and museums; they attempted to reconstruct the appearance of these prehistoric creatures and to explain their extinction. Long thought to be fantasy, the remarkably detailed and perceptive Greek and Roman accounts of giant bone finds were actually based on solid paleontological facts. By reading these neglected narratives for the first time in the light of modern scientific discoveries, Adrienne Mayor illuminates a lost world of ancient paleontology. As Peter Dodson writes in his Foreword, "Paleontologists, classicists, and historians as well as natural history buffs will read this book with the greatest of delight--surprises abound."</p></p><p>Since fossils have presumably existed for millions of years, why don't we see much paleontological thought from ancient writers? Classics scholar Adrienne Mayor suggests that we can, in fact, learn much about the Greek and Roman attitudes toward fossils if we turn to a surprising source of data and theory: their myths. In <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i>, she explores likely connections between the rich fossil beds around the Mediterranean and tales of griffins and giants originating in the classical world. Striking similarities exist between the <i>Protoceratops</i> skeletons of the Gobi Desert and the legends of the gold-hoarding griffin told by nomadic people of the region, and the fossilized remains of giant Miocene mammals could be taken for the heroes and monsters of earlier times. Mayor makes her case well, but, as with all interpretive science, the arguments are inconclusive. Still, her novel reading of ancient myth--and her critique of the modern scientific mythology that seeks to explain the lack of classical paleontological thinking--is compelling and thought-provoking.<p> The final chapter of <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i> is an engrossing and occasionally quite funny look at "Paleontological Fictions" dating back several thousand years; the false tritons and centaurs give P.T. Barnum and his successors a much longer genealogy than previously thought. Whether or not you accept Mayor's analysis of Greek and Roman thinking, <i>The First Fossil Hunters</i> should open your eyes to new possibilities about our distant past. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>"In this wonderful book, Adrienne Mayor successfully convinces us that some of our most treasured mythical creatures really were based on the skeletons of extinct animals. It is the best account ever concerning the real meaning of mythical creatures. And Mayor has succeeded in setting the history of paleontology on its ear: the art of skeletal restoration was not invented in the western world."<b>--Jack Horner, Museum of the Rockies, author of<i>Dinosaur Lives</i></b></p><p>"Adrienne Mayor's sometimes provocative and always fascinating blend of history, mythology, and science offers a uniquely enriched dimension to the quest for fossils."<b>--Michael Novacek, American Museum of Natural History</b></p><p>"The Greeks were not the only peoples of antiquity to exploit the past in the interests of devising myth and history, but they were among the most ingenious about it, and recorded their views. Adrienne Mayor has uncovered a barely noticed source for many of the myths of the Old World, and for the first time has assembled in an orderly way the evidence for early man's discovery of and explanations for fossil remains. This is a skillful blend of science, history and imagination which adds a chapter to the history of man's ingenuity, from Central Asia to Greece, to Egypt. Many texts, sites, and pictures will never seem quite the same again, after this very thorough and very lively scholarly excursion into a disregarded source of myth-making."<b>--John Boardman, Oxford University</b></p><p>"A brilliant book, full of new insights into the myths and past of the ancient Greeks.

He lives in Strasbourg, France.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;These whimsical wordless picture books star a likable pup with a brown spot over one eye and floppy ears that stand up, down, or out to the sides to express a variety of emotions. Polo lives in a cozy duplex inside a large tree that fills up most of a tiny island. In the first story, the pooch's solitary lifestyle is interrupted when Lily, a rabbitlike character cruising along on a flying cloud, accidentally crashes into his window and the two spend a pleasant day together. In the second book, Polo's fishing expedition turns into a Zen adventure, as he is shipwrecked on an island where he meets a mystical koala and journeys home via a flying rug powered by a magic flute. The action is conveyed entirely through the cartoon artwork, presented on single pages and in panels. Employing bright crystalline hues, sharp black lines, and delightfully delineated details, the playful illustrations clearly convey the specifics of the story lines while establishing a fanciful world in which wondrous things are believably commonplace. The wordless format encourages kids to take an active role in the storytelling, identifying the important plot elements, discerning the sequencing, and verbalizing the action. These books will captivate youngsters' imaginations and nurture literacy skills.<i>&#x2013;Joy Fleishhacker,</i> School Library Journal <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The resultant theory highlights the need for the public accountability of private economic power, arguing that when the private economic realm is unable to adequately guarantee the rights of citizens, the state must intervene to protect those rights. The New Deal created a new American social contract that accorded our right to the pursuit of happiness a status equal to liberty, and grounded both in an expansive idea of security as the necessary precondition for the exercise of either. This was connected to a theory of the common good that privileged the consumer as the central category while simultaneously working to limit the worst excesses of consumption-oriented individualism. This theory of ends was supplemented by a theory of practice that focused on ways to institutionalize progressive politics in a conservative institutional context. Brian Stipelman, drawing upon a mixture of history, American political development, and political theory, offers a comprehensive theory of the New Deal, covering both the ends it hoped to achieve and the means it used to achieve them.</p><p>Brian Stipelman teaches American politics and political theory at Dowling College.[This is a] unique work in the field that will garner much praise from scholars in political science, political theory, and history. . . . [Stipelman] presents a fresh, vigorous analysis of the theoretical and political underpinnings of the New Deal and assesses not only its roots and successes, but also its continued relevance for contemporary politics, policy, and theory. For far too long, scholarship on the New Deal has been almost exclusively the domain of historians and historically-oriented political scientists. This study offers something unique and bold: a study of the political theory of the New Deal conceived not in abstract terms, but in terms of real politics while offering a compelling argument for the continued relevance of the theory of the New Deal for contemporary politics and political thought. Although the author focuses upon a set of thinkers&#x2014;specifically Franklin Roosevelt, Henry Wallace, Thurman Arnold, and Eleanor Roosevelt&#x2014;he escapes the typical trap of biography and the reduction of the New Deal to individual thinkers alone. This is an important, and timely work. (Michael J. Thompson, William Paterson University)<br><br>An important book for both citizens and scholars. Brian Stipelman explores the meaning of the New Deal&#x2014;as political theory, as political practice, and as a story to be understood and passed on. His meticulous scholarship offers us a powerful new understanding of the New Deal. His engaging conclusions offer us a fresh way to think about politics&#x2014;and about liberalism in America. Bold, fresh, elegant, thoughtful, wise, and highly recommended.<br> (Brown University, James A. Morone, Brown University)<br><br>Historians and political scientists largely have viewed the New Deal as an almost purely political project. While a few historians and scholars of American political development have outlined a political theory of the New Deal, Stipelman (Dowling College) offers what is likely the first book-length study that takes seriously the ideas of New Deal Democrats. The author focuses on four key figures: Franklin Delano Roosevelt; his wife, Eleanor; his key aide (and eventual vice president), Henry A. Wallace; and the legal scholar and practitioner Thurman Arnold. Going beyond these thinkers' ideas about state intervention and institution building, Stipelman articulates the key assumptions about economics, liberty and happiness, and class structure that underlie their political thought. Some scholars may disagree with the author's emphasis on particular aspects of New Deal theory, such as the choice of consumerism as the basis of happiness and security. But even critical readers will appreciate this fine volume for its role in starting the conversation. Summing Up: Highly recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Stipelman offers a comprehensive theory of the New Deal, covering both the ends it hoped to achieve and the means it used to achieve them. It draws upon a mixture of history, American political development, and political theory, and hopes to both fill a critical gap in scholarship and provide a theoretical framework for contemporary progressive political actors.</p><h2>Contempt of Court: The Turn Of-The-Century Lynching That Launched 100 Years of Federalism</h2><p>The case by which the U.S. Supreme Court declared itself the highest court in the land. <p>When Ed Johnson, a black man, was wrongly convicted in 1906 of rape and sentenced to death in Tennessee, Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan issued a stay of execution, declaring that Johnson's right to a fair trial had been violated and that he had been railroaded through the criminal justice system. The interference of the Supreme Court was not well received back in Chattanooga. A violent mob answered this federal "interference" by dragging Johnson from his jail cell, beating him, and hanging him from a bridge. Local police did nothing to prevent the lynching, nor were any members of the mob arrested. For the first and only time in history, an enraged Supreme Court conducted a criminal trial to enforce its authority. It brought criminal contempt of court charges against the sheriff, his deputies, and members of the lynch mob. </p><p>The first book written about these highly charged events, Contempt of Court raises issues of federalism versus states' rights that are as timely today as they were ninety years ago. Johnson's case led to a precedent-setting criminal trial that is unique in the annals of American jurisprudence. Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips's riveting tale will prove essential reading for all interested in understanding how American justice works.</p></p><p>Prior to 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court had never tried a criminal case--and the high court had yet to assert its power over state criminal courts. That was all to change after the events of a cold January night earlier that year in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Blond, beautiful, 21-year-old Nevada Taylor had hopped on one of Chattanooga's new electric trolleys after work. Before she could reach home, the young woman was waylaid and raped by an unknown assailant. At first Taylor couldn't describe her attacker to town sheriff Joseph Shipp, as she hadn't seen the man clearly, but she soon became convinced he was "a Negro with a soft, kind voice." In just 17 days, a drifter dubbed a "Negro fiend" by the <i>Chattanooga News</i> had been hastily arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to hang.<p> Two idealistic black lawyers intervened, filing appeals to the state and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court, citing the numerous rights denied the most-likely innocent Ed Johnson. (One of the attorneys said of the suspect, "But for the will of God, that is me.") The high court agreed to hear the appeal, staying the Tennessee execution. But back in Chattanooga, the politically minded Sheriff Shipp looked the other way as a bloodthirsty crowd of hundreds broke Johnson out of jail, beat him brutally, and lynched him on the county bridge.</p><p> Mark Curriden, a legal writer for the <i>Dallas Morning News</i>, and Leroy Phillips, a Chattanooga trial attorney, have painstakingly researched and vividly recounted the events of this oft-overlooked but significant episode in America's legal history, from the details of the original crime to the eventual federal conviction of Shipp and members of the lynch mob for contempt. A superb combination of journalistic storytelling and academic rigor. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>In this profound and fascinating book, the authors revisit an overlooked Supreme Court decision that changed forever how justice is carried out in the United States. <br>In 1906, Ed Johnson was the innocnet black man found guilty of the brutal rape of Nevada Taylor, a white woman, and sentenced to die in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Two black lawyers, not even part of the original defense, appealed to the Supreme Court for a stay of execution, and the stay, incredibly, was granted. Frenzied with rage at the deision, locals responded by lynching Johnson, and what ensued was a breathtaking whirlwind of groundbreaking legal action whose import, Thurgood Marshall would claim, "has never been fully explained." Provocative, thorough, and gripping, <b>Contempt of Court</b> is a long-overdue look at events that clearly depict the peculiar and tenuous relationship between justice and the law. <br> <br></p><h2>Sex on the Brain: 12 Lessons to Enhance Your Love Life</h2><p>&#x201c;The vast majority of love and sex occurs in the brain.

You'd think, "It's hopeless, why bother trying." Right? Or would you think, "The woman telling me this is crazy and I'd better get me and all my worldly goods out of here?"<br><br>Or would you be like me and think, "A story! Everyone's into time travel now and nobody's doing past lives, so maybe I can ask a lot of questions and make a story from this lady's answers."<br><br>This last is what I thought when I first met Nora because I am a writer inside and out. There isn't one molecule of me that isn't geared toward, How can I use this in a story?<br><br>People are always asking me how I came to be a writer. I'd like to have an answer that would please them. I'd like to say that I was walking through a meadow full of tiny blue flowers when a beautiful woman in a silver dress appeared and bopped me on the head with her wand. She had a golden voice and said, "I am giving you the gift of writing. Go forth and write."<br><br>Sometimes I think that people want to hear that I was "chosen," rather like a prophet. But you know, whenever you read about prophets, they <i>always</i> cry to God, "Oh Lord, why me?" Sometimes I think being "chosen" isn't a gift, it's a curse.<br><br>At any rate, I have just told you why I became a writer. I make up stories about everything. Absolutely everything on earth. I see something, hear something, read something, and my mind starts creating a story.<br><br>Storytelling is natural to me. When people ask me how I came to be a writer, what I want to ask in return is, What is in your head in place of stories? What do you <i>think</i> about while listening to a terminally boring speech? While driving a car? While putting the sixth load of wash in the machine? To me, this is the real mystery of life. I already know what's inside my head, but what is inside other people's heads if not stories?<br><br>Well, anyway, now that I am a full-fledged writer (that means I need no outside job to pay the bills) I find that we writers have a little club that we're all supposed to be loyal to. The Hippocratic oath is nothing compared to this.<br><br>Since I don't want to lose my writing membership, I'll say what I'm supposed to. <i>It's bloody hard work writing.</i> What is that thing someone said about opening a vein and spilling your blood onto the paper? Well, it's true. Writing is really, really hard work. By golly, I bet I sit on my fanny six to ten hours a day. I pace the floor thinking about "what happens next." I have a publishing house that sends me flowers and money every time I turn in a book.<br><br>Now, really, does it sound like a writer suffers more than, say, a secretary? She has to be awakened by an alarm clock (I wake when I want to), get the kids and hubby off, work for a boss who never praises her, then do another shift of work when she gets home. And no one ever says, "Wow, you're a secretary. How did you get to be one?"<br><br>I guess we all do whatever we can. If you can drive a truck, you do that. If you can hassle people without conscience. you become a lawyer. If you have stories in your head you write them down. To me being a writer isn't any different and not nearly as important as most other professions. But it seems that the world doesn't agree with me. The world at large has decided that writers are smarter, more astute, more enlightened, more whatever than other people, so they treat them with awe and reverence.<br><br>My opinion is that we should have a National Profession Lottery and every year about ten professions would be drawn from a hat, and for that year all the praise would go to the people in those professions. They should have best-seller lists, receive fan letters, have autographing parties, and have something like a publishing house to praise them and give them gifts.<br><br>See? There I go again with a story. Give me a keyboard and I can't stop.<br><br>However, about these ten professions to be chosen, I want to make it clear that there is one "profession" that is too evil to be included in this lottery. Book reviewers. Specifically, romance book reviewers.<br><br>Maybe I should tell you right now so, if you are offended, you can stop reading this book. I write romances.<br><br>There, I've said it. It's out in the open.<br><br>For all the joy of my life, there is one aspect of it that is really and truly quite awful. Shockingly awful. And that is the way the world looks at romance novels, at romance readers, and, above all, at romance <i>writers!</i><br><br>Isn't the world a weird place? I saw a man on <i>Oprah</i> who was admitting that he'd had sex with his daughter several times when she was a child. Nearly every actor/singer tells the world he/she has done every drug known and hurt or driven away most of the people in their lives.<br><br>And how are all these people greeted? With love, that's how. With love and understanding and sympathy.<br><br>But here I am and what do I do? I write funny little romantic stories about men and women who fall in love with each other. The wildest thing they do is make a baby or two. No drugs. No incest. No one boiling anyone and doing heaven only knows what else to them. I don't even have people plotting clever ways to kill someone. I just invent stories about what we all dream about: having someone to love who loves us in return.<br><br>You'd think that the very thought of a romance writer would bring a smile to people's lips. Ah, how nice. Love. Making love. Laughter. Kissing.<br><br>But no, the world is upside down as far as I can see, and romances and their writers are ridiculed, hissed, and generally spat upon.<br><br>And for what reasons? One of my favorites is that women who read them might get mixed up about reality and imagine a man is going to rescue them from Life. According to this theory, women are so stupid that they can't tell a story from reality. Is anyone worried that the <i>men</i> who read spy thrillers are going to go after their neighbors with an automatic weapon? No, I don't remember anyone thinking that. Nor do I remember anyone worrying about murder mysteries or science fiction. It just seems to be dumb ol' women who might think some gorgeous, thoughtful, giving hunk is going to rescue them.<br><br>Honey, if any woman thought a gorgeous hunk was going to rescue her, romance novels wouldn't be forty percent of the publishing industry.<br><br>Anyway, back to the reviewers. These smart young people graduate from college with dreams of working on some magazine of intellectual merit, and what happens to them? Some old man who no longer has stars in his eyes decides to teach the young whippersnapper a lesson about life so he gives this child the lowest job in all the industry: <i>reviewing romance novels!</i><br><br>Guess who bears the brunt of the newly graduated person's rage? Eighty grand spent on education and they are given a book to read that has a nursing mother cover (so called because of the size of the you-know-whats and the obviously about-to-be-lowered bodice [Quiz: do you think a man or a woman invented these covers?]).<br><br>Anyway, this person takes her/his rage out on me, the romance writer. The lowest creature on earth. A housewife with a bank account.<br><br>Rule number one for reviewing a romance novel: compare the book to the <i>best</i> book you've ever read. If it does not live up to Jane Austen, then use about sixty grand of your education to cut this writer down in the nastiest way possible. If, however, you should make the error of liking the book, write that "Readers of Hayden Lane should like this one." Whatever you do, don't stick your neck out and actually say <i>you</i> liked the book. If you allow anyone to think you like romances, you'll never get promoted to reviewing the "good" books.<br><br>So, anyway, what does all this have to do with the subject of past lives? It has everything to do with it because, you see, I'm thirty-nine years old; I'm about to hit the big four-oh, and I'm trying to figure out some things about my life. Sometimes I think I'm as curious as my readers as to how I became a writer. What <i>does</i> make us what we are today?<br><br>All in all, the most interesting thing to analyze is people. Why does the lady down the street dress with military precision? Why does someone have a fear of knives or fire or high places? What about those people who are too afraid to leave their houses?<br><br>There is, of course, the theory that every fear in your adult life was caused by something awful that happened in your childhood, preferably something you don't remember so that a therapist can see you hundreds of times and charge you thousands of dollars to help you remember this dreadful thing. So after therapy you're poorer and have some more rotten memories as well.<br><br>During a bad time in my life (what can cause a woman a "bad time" except a man?) I went to a therapist. She told me that I had stories going through my head because I wanted to go to bed with my father. When I recovered my power of speech, I said in great indignation, "I did <i>not</i> want to go to bed with my father!" "Oh," she said calmly, "then you suppressed it."<br><br>Seeing that I couldn't win -- and winning has always been important to me -- I didn't return after that visit.<br><br>But I have tried to figure out why I write and why I write what I do. You see, all writers want one thing. They want immortality. That's why we're so vain that we think someone else will want to read what we put down on paper. We writers hear of Mark Twain dying in poverty and feel no sympathy because ol' Mark attained the goal. He will live forever. Our families would no doubt choose for us to be writers who make lots of money, but we writers would take eternal recognition over wealth every time.<br><br>But that's the problem. No one comes to you, sitting on a pink cloud, a clipboard in hand, and says, "We're giving you the gift of writing. Do you want the kind that everyone sneers at or the kind that people remember after you're dead?" Talent is not like a used car. You can't take it back if you don't like it. You can't say, "I'd like to trade in my talent for an Edith Wharton model."<br><br>My talent happens to be in writing romantic novels, and they get laughed at and ridiculed. In any movie, if the director wants to show that a female character is stupid, he puts a romance novel into her hands.<br><br>Early on, I decided that I was grateful for any talent at all. Those who can, do, and those who can't, review. As Anthony Trollope said, "Only a blockhead writes for anything except money." Or thereabouts. Anyway, it's true. You can't very well sit down at your computer and say, "I'm now going to write my way into history." It doesn't work that way. You don't decide what lives on after you, other people do.<br><br>So, anyway, I still wonder how I came to write romantic novels and I look back at my life to see if I can figure out what made me such a writer. In fact, I'd like to know what made me like I am in every aspect.<br><br>Until I was seven years old, I was the happiest child on the planet. My parents and sister and I lived next door to two houses filled with cousins and aunts and uncles and a couple of sets of grandparents. It was heaven. I was the ringleader of the bunch, ordering everyone about, telling them what to do and how to do it. My creativity was truly appreciated.<br><br>Well, maybe not appreciated by everyone. There was the time I saw my grandmother twist the head off a chicken, so I told my cousin we ought to help Nana and twist the heads off all the chickens. There we were, no more than five years old, chickens tucked between our scraped knees and twisting and twisting and twisting. My grandmother came out of the house with a load of wash and there were all her chickens, their heads cocked to one side, listing drunkenly about the yard. Looking back on it and thinking of the ferocious temper of my grandmother, I don't know how my cousin and I escaped alive.<br><br>But those wonderful years ended soon enough when my mother decided she'd had enough of her mother-in-law's renowned temper. My mother (who could defeat any temper with her rock-hard stubbornness) on one fateful day informed my father that she had bought a piece of land and he was going to build her a house on it. In my parents' household we all liked to pretend that my father was the one who made the rules. I think the rule he made was, Give Mama what she wants or she'll make life hell for all of us. Whatever his thoughts, he wasn't fool enough to say no to my mother when she had <i>that</i> look in her eye.<br><br>Whatever the philosophy behind it, the result was the same: We moved. In that one day I lost all those cousins and grandparents; I lost the chickens and the cows and the possum that lived in a barrel in the barn. I lost blackberry bushes that gave me chiggers and I lost apple trees to climb. In one day I went from being the champion of all, a person of prime importance, to being the child-who-must-be-kept-down.<br><br>In a matter of hours I went from having the most exciting life in the world to having a life of supreme dullness. My mother and sister were cut out of the same cloth. They were good. Good, good, good.<br><br><i>What</i> is more boring than good? My mother was always saying, "Don't eat too much chocolate. It'll make you sick!' or "I can't look at that right now. I have too much work to do" or "Hayden, you cannot read that book now. You haven't finished cleaning the bathroom." On and on she went. There was a right time and a wrong time for everything. But as far as I could tell the right time for exuberance never came.<br><br>Didn't people ever want to do something that wasn't on the schedule? Was I the only one in the world who actually wanted to eat as much chocolate as I could hold and damn the consequences?<br><br>Looking back, I think that some people are afraid to break out of the rules. Maybe they're afraid that if they break the rules, they'll lose all self-control and become something horrible -- in my mother's case that would be a woman with a dirty bathroom floor.<br><br>Whatever was behind it all, again the result was the same: I was put in a bubble of isolation and left there alone. I had to try to remember to sit up straight, walk sedately, and never, never be rambunctious. I tried, but it's difficult to control yourself when you're a child. I guess an awful lot of me slipped out because I heard the phrase "You know how you are" a few million times. Sometimes I got the feeling that my parents thought that if they didn't keep me under rigid control every minute of every day that I'd lose it altogether. Maybe I'd start eating chocolate and laughing and just plain <i>never stop.</i> Maybe they feared not being able to reel me back in if they just let me go ahead and <i>be myself.</i><br><br>Now that I'm an adult and know all about adult things (uh-huh, sure) I know that my parents were not creative and I was. If they bought something that needed assembly, they read the box and put it together in the way the manufacturer wanted them to. If I bought something, I felt that reading the instructions was cheating. And if I couldn't put it together easily, it was quite ordinary for me to jump up and down on the box and say all the dirty words I knew -- which, thankfully, weren't many.<br><br>My punishment for box jumping or any infraction of the peace rules was to be talked to "for my own good." Never in my life have I understood that phrase. When someone says this is "for your own good" it always, always, <i>always</i> means that someone is trying to make you openly acknowledge his or her superior power.<br><br>So, anyway, how did I survive these spirit killers? How did I s...</p><h2>Marco Polo: Overland to China (In the Footsteps of Explorers)</h2><p>This book is intended for ages 8-14.

The Nazis have been in power for just eighteen months but already Germany has seen some frightening changes. As the city prepares to host the 1936 Olympics, Jews are being expelled from all German sporting organisations - a blatant example of discrimination. Forced to resign as a homicide detective with Berlin&#39;s Criminal Police, Bernie is now house detective at the famous Adlon Hotel. Two bodies are found - one a businessman and the other a Jewish boxer. As Bernie digs to unearth the truth, he discovers a vast labour and construction racket designed to take advantage of the huge sums the Nazis are spending to showcase the new Germany to the world. It is a plot that finds its dramatic and violent conclusion twenty years later in pre-revolutionary Cuba.</p><p>Philip Kerr is the author of the internationally bestselling Bernie Gunther novels. If the Dead Rise Not won the CWA Ellis Peters Award for Best Historical Novel. His other books include several stand-alone thrillers and acclaimed series for children. He lives in south-west London.When we last saw Bernie Gunther, the Weimar Germany police detective and, later, reluctant SS officer in World War II had worn out his welcome in postwar Argentina (A Quiet Flame, 2009). Now it&#x2019;s 1954, and Kerr&#x2019;s cynical Chandlerian crime-solver has landed in Cuba, attempting to stay under the radar of those who consider him a Nazi war criminal. But Kerr is well aware that the heart and soul of his celebrated series remain in 1930s Berlin, where Weimar decadence sang its swan song to the rhythm of Brownshirts marching in lockstep. So, as he did in A Quiet Flame, Kerr combines the postwar story with a flashback to Bernie&#x2019;s Berlin heyday. This time it&#x2019;s 1934, and the Nazis are gearing up for the 1936 Olympics. Bernie falls headlong for American Jewish reporter Noreen Charalambides and agrees to help her promote a U.S. boycott of the Olympics by telling the real story about the Nazis&#x2019; treatment of the Jews. The plan falls apart, of course, leaving Bernie with a broken heart and Noreen on a boat for the States. Flash-forward to Havana, where Bernie runs into Noreen in a bookstore and quickly finds himself in another mess, this one involving American gangsters, Cuban rebels, and Noreen&#x2019;s frisky daughter. There&#x2019;s more than enough succulent atmosphere here for two novels, one for each setting. Both stories and both locales deserve star billing and seem a bit shortchanged without it. Still, there&#x2019;s so much to enjoy here that it seems churlish to complain. On any continent, in any decade, no one does melancholy better than Bernie Gunther, and melancholy, after all, is the hard-boiled mystery fan&#x2019;s emotion of choice. --Bill Ott</p><h2>How Do You Count a Dozen Ducklings?</h2><p>A mama duck with a dozen eggs has to do a lot of counting! Mama counts her ducklings one by one as they hatch, but soon she finds clever new ways to count to twelve--by twos, threes, fours, and sixes!</p><p>Seon Chae is a contributor for Square One Publishers titles including <i>How Do You Count a Dozen Ducklings?</i>PreSchool-K&#x2013;To keep track of her 12 ducklings, Mama Duck groups them and regroups them&#x2013;in twos, then threes, then fours, and finally in two lines of six. A hungry wolf with poor eyesight smells them marching through the weeds and decides to attack. Hearing One, two, he thinks that it will be easy for him to capture his lunch. Hes in for a surprise when he learns that Mama Duck has her offspring in two groups, and that 12 ducklings can pack a punch. Each little bird has an individual hairstyle and a personality to go with it, making the bold color illustrations fun to follow while looking for the wolf. Kids will enjoy this read-aloud that introduces math concepts. The text falls short as some rhymes work (back/track) while others do not (out/count), but dont let that stop anyone from enjoying the educational value of this book and its funny little quackers.<i>&#x2013;Sandra Welzenbach, Villarreal Elementary School, San Antonio, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The royal twins Barrick and Briony have done their best to hold the kingdom together, but now Barrick has been captured and Briony has been forced to flee the castle.

The crippled Prince Barrick has fallen over the Shadowline, where he is eventually befriended by an ancient Qar&#x2019; (i.e., fairy) king, though for the king&#x2019;s own purposes. Princess Briony has landed in a foreign court with only her wits to protect her. Southmarch Castle, home of the prince and the princess, is besieged by the Qar&#x2019;, and their father has been captured by the mad Autarch of Xis, who wants to use King Olin to release an ancient power. And all that is just at the book&#x2019;s outset. Williams builds strongly on the plots of Shadowmarch (2004) and Shadowplay (2007), which he summarizes here because knowing them is absolutely necessary to enjoying this book.

His fame rests mainly on the achievement of the epic Aubrey/Maturin novels, but few readers know that O'Brian first made his reputation as a writer of short fiction. Collected here are twenty-seven stories that O'Brian wished to preserve: stories of uncommon lyricism and beauty that will confirm his rightful place in the front rank of short-story writers as well as of novelists.</p><p>Although the tone of this collection ranges effortlessly from the humorous to the dramatic, the most characteristic and memorable stories often have to do with a glimpse of savage, destructive forces through the fragile shell of human civilization. The threatened chaos may be psychological, as in "On the Wolfsberg," or it may be lurking in the natural world, as in "A Passage of the Frontier," or, as in the dark masterpiece "The Chian Wine," it is suddenly discovered in the ancient, irrational impulses of human nature.</p><p>The setting may be the marshes of western Ireland, the Pyrenees, or the claustrophobic confines of a clockmender's house, but each story is a showcase for Patrick O'Brian's fresh and meticulous prose; each story reaffirms his sympathetic understanding of human passion and suffering. This collection proves that O'Brian is not simply the master of a genre, but an author who will long be honored as one of our most eminent literary figures.</p></p><p>Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format.In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O&#39;Brian wrote several books including the novels Testimonies, The Golden Ocean, and The Unknown Shore, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture&#39;s biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherri�re&#39;s memoir Papillon. O&#39;Brian died in January 2000.His reputation as a novelist secure, O'Brian (The Wine-Dark Sea, 1993, etc.) here seeks to cement his reputation as a short- story writer. The author has established a deservedly devoted following in this country for his Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin 18th-century naval series, but this group of 27 stories, originally published between 1950 and 1974, is not, taken as a whole, as strong. He is much interested in obscure journeys across frontiers and unhappy marriages, and many of the tales are more vignettes than classic short stories. Early entries feature solitary men who are invariably disoriented and buffeted by natural forces (or by forces implicitly beyond natural ones) while engaged in fishing, fox hunting, pigeon shoots, and other outdoor pursuits. In ``The Happy Despatch,'' for example, Woolen, a poverty-stricken Englishman stuck in a horrid marriage and living as an outcast in an Irish village, stumbles across a stash of golden coins while fishing high in the hills. What seems a sudden shift in his fortunes turns into something very like a horror story in the abrupt, enigmatic ending. In ``The Tunnel at the Frontier,'' a befuddled traveler appears to be passing from life to death. ``Lying in the Sun'' offers these thoughts from a man on the beach with his insipid wife: ``If only she would go away, he would be quite fond of her; he would indeed, and he would do all he possibly could to be agreeable by post.'' Later stories are less claustrophobic and more striking, especially the dark and bitter ``The Chian Wine,'' in which the planned ceremonial drinking of an ancient cask of spirits is precluded by timeless violence, and the volume's unexpectedly amusing final entry, ``On the Wolfsberg,'' wherein yet another solitary wanderer (female this time) learns a startling truth. Eloquent and elegant as expected, these often intriguing tales are never quite as enthralling as one might hope. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For this beautifully realized volume the artist has selected the best photographs from his first decade of work. The first edition is sure to become one of McGinley&#39;s most collectable books. Ryan McGinley makes large-scale color photographs of his friends, a group that forms part of New York&#39;s Lower East Side youth culture. He uses photography to break down barriers between public and private spheres of activity. His subjects are willing collaborators: drawn from skateboard, music, and graffiti subcultures, they perform for the camera and expose themselves with a frank self-awareness that is distinctly contemporary. The results form a portrait of a generation that is savvy about visual culture and acutely aware of how identity can be communicated through photography. McGinley&#39;s newest work signals a departure from the urban youth culture images for which he is best known; he has been working in natural settings outside New York City, creating specific situations for his subjects to lose themselves in the moment. McGinley embraces nature as a site of freedom and captures a sense of buoyancy and release.</p><p></p><h2>Speaking for Vice: Homosexuality in the Art of Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, and the First American Avant-Garde (Yale Publications in the History of Art)</h2><p>This provocative book explores the representation of male homosexuality in American art in the first half of the twentieth century. Focusing on the work of Charles Demuth and Marsden Hartley, it uncovers the sexual codes and references in their art and explores how the two men reconciled their production of a self-consciously &#34;American&#34; art with the representation of their own marginalized status as both homosexuals and avant-garde artists.</p><p></p><h2>Betrayal at Lisson Grove</h2><p>Another fantastic Pitt novel from the master storyteller of the Victorian mystery. 1895 and an increasingly violent tide of political unrest is rising fast all over Europe.

When he finds himself in pursuit of a suspected terrorist, Pitt has no hesitation in following the chase all the way to France. But events take a sinister turn when Narraway, Pitt&#39;s superior, is accused of involvement in the death of an Irish informant and abruptly removed from office. Aware that her husband&#39;s own career is also in jeopardy if he is not reinstated, Pitt&#39;s wife Charlotte determines to help Narraway clear his name. As Charlotte and Narraway depart for Ireland and Pitt is drawn deeper into the investigation in France, it becomes clear that outside forces have conspired to separate them at a crucial time in the country&#39;s history. With no one else to trust can they make it back to England and stop the revolt before it&#39;s too late?</p><p>Anne Perry is a New York Times bestselling author noted for her memorable characters, historical accuracy and exploration of social and ethical issues.

It is the story of the cowboy way of life--the starry nights and mountain air. And it is the story and mystery of the author's recurring vision of the blonde dream woman who broke into his solitary existence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich Hobson and his business partner, Panhandle "Pan" Phillips, have established themselves in British Columbia's wild interior as successful cattle ranchers. But their skills are about to be put to the ultimate test as a harsh winter arrives--and so does the Great White North's entrance into the Second World War. With intolerable weather conditions and a shortage of supplies, Rich and Pan will have to pull out all the stops in order to ensure the survival of themselves and their livelihood. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the celebrated author of <i>Grass Beyond the Mountains</i> comes a true adventure story, told by a natural rancher, pioneer, and storyteller.</p><p>Richmond P. Hobson Jr. (1907-1966) was born in Washington, DC, where he worked with pack outfits, survey crews, and construction gangs, saving, all the while, to buy a cattle ranch. He came to Canada after the stock market crash of the late 1920s. He and his business partner, Panhandle "Pan" Phillips, moved to the interior of British Columbia and established the Frontier Cattle Company in the 1930s.

The story of their development begins during the late 19th Century and carries through the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, the civil disturbances in Central America in the 1920s and '30s, Prohibition, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War and the Persian Gulf War. <p>Because the Winchester Model 1897 and 1912 were the most commonly used combat shotguns up to the Vietnam War period, the book concentrates heavily on these two models, but by no means neglects the many Remington, Stevens, Ithaca, Mossberg and other shotguns used by U.S. military forces to the present day. </p><p>A part-by-part analysis of the Winchester Models 1897 and 1912 is provided with emphasis differentiating between World War I and World War II models. Serial number ranges are listed and factory and inspector's markings are interpreted. The differences between riot guns and trench guns are explained and the different variations of bayonet mount/handguards are described and related to serial number ranges. The many and difficult problems in determining if a particular riot or trench shotgun was used by the military during World War I is explained. </p><p>During World War II, the U.S. military purchased variety of shotguns from several different companies. Some of these shotguns were originally built and marked for the civilian market. Each variation is explained and points of identification are listed. Shotguns purchased and used by the U.S. military through the Persian Gulf War are included.</p></p><p>This book is unique in its detailed coverage of all U.S. military shotguns. There are no other books or magazine articles that cover military shotguns in this depth available in English.</p><h2>A False Spring</h2><p>In <i>A False Spring</i>, Pat Jordan traces the falling star of his once-promising pitching career, illuminating along the way his equally difficult personal struggles and quest for maturity.

The stunningly wide-ranging coverage included appearances on The Rosie ODonnell Show, MTVs Real World, and The Early Show, print features in everything from USA Today to The Advocate, and a website deluged with e-mails from fans. One of the most original writers of a new generation was launched. His new novel, The Snow Garden, is a story of murder and sexual menace on a snowbound university campus. When a respected professors wife drives to her death in an icy river, an illicit relationship between a student and his teacher threatens to come to light, and within days Atherton University is the scene of escalating speculation and intrigue. Another death emerges from the shadows, and the connections between the two accidents begin to look uncomfortably close. As in A Density of Souls, Christopher Rice explores the dynamic within a tightly knit group of young people haunted by sexual memories and fears and driven by obscure desires. The Snow Garden casts this web of friendship and passion against the backdrop of a threat that grows darker as the novel proceeds. The result is a stunning new novel from an arresting talent.</p><p>Christopher Rice is the son of Anne Rice, the novelist, and Stan Rice, the poet. He lives in Los Angeles. The Snow Garden is his second novel.<p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Inverness Creek</p><p>Groping at the icy tree trunks and pushing branches from his face, he followed the sound of water flowing against the ice until it brought him to the edge of Inverness Creek. The haggard elms stood in regiments along the sloping banks of ice-slick mud. Veils of snow danced on contrary gusts of wind before vanishing into ice punctuated by sudden black pools of creek water. The music of Fraternity Green was an eerie, distant suggestion far behind him. Bursts of drunken laughter and the delighted squeals of young women, underscored by the bass thud of a stereo, barely filtered through the thicket of trees to where he stood, steadying himself on a branch, staring down at Pamela Milford. </p><p>She was lying facedown on a sheet of ice that bobbed in the struggling current, her blonde hair fanned forward from her head. A few strands draped the side of her face where her cheek puffed against the upward press of the ice, the corner of her mouth open slightly as if she was trying to draw breath. One arm was pinned beneath her chest; the other was frozen in midreach for the far bank. Her right leg shot outward at an awkward angle from her body. A miniature geyser erupted around the toe of the boot on her left foot, water spilling over the top of the ice, a puncture that revealed the frailty of the sheet she lay on.</p><p>From this distance, the red trail extending out from her neck could easily have been mistaken for blood. He knew better.....</p></p><h2>Cultural Anthropology</h2><p><p>This volume on cultural anthropology presents a Christian perspective for Bible school students of conservative evangelical backgrounds. The hope is that a sympathetic approach to the problems of cultural diversity throughout the world will help young people overcome typical North American cultural biases and bring understanding and appreciation for the diversities of behavior and thought that exist in a culturally heterogeneous world. Grunlan and Mayers take the position of "functional creationism"; and though they discuss some of the problems implied in traditional interpretations of the age of the world and especially of the creation of the human race, they do not attempt to deal with either physical anthropology or the origins of man. They do, however, attempt to deal meaningfully with the problems posed by biblical absolutism and cultural relativism, and their practice. Concluding chapters with a series of thought-provoking questions should prove to be of real help to both the professional and nonprofessional teacher of anthropology.</p></p><p>Stephen A. Grunlan (DMin, Luther Theological Seminary) is pastor of Grace Fellowship, an Evangelical Free church in Overland Park, Kansas, and adjunct instructor in sociology at Grossmont College.

Richly printed in duotone, these 112 black-and-white images of moors, trees, ancient stones, and mountains reveal a landscape charged by brilliant light and intriguing composition. Jeffrey's introduction finds the work ``ceaselessly interested in differences between the wild and the cultivated, between what is primal, vast and even boundless, and what is orderly and near to hand.'' Indeed, the action in the clouds, the lines in the fences and fields, the mystery in the fog are striking and yet calm. This is a much more accomplished and lavish production than Godwin's earlier collaboration with John Fowles in Islands (Little, 1978). Many of the images have been published previously, but are fine to see here. Recommended. Ann Copeland, Drew Univ.

Booklist heralded Ms. Frizzle as &#34;the wackiest, wisest teacher in picture books.&#34; Two MSB titles have been named School Library Journal Best Books of the Year, and they have won countless state book awards, from New York to Nebraska.Readers eager to hop aboard Ms. Frizzle's bus for another junket will not be disappointed by this latest expedition. It's visitor's day at school and the students have turned the classroom into Dinosaur Land, but the impulsive teacher nevertheless announces a dinosaur dig, and the class piles onto the magic school bus. At the site, paleontologists have uncovered the bones of some Maiasaura dinosaurs, but are disappointed that they haven't found any nests. With a characteristic gleam in her eye, Ms. Frizzle asks, "Want to look for some Maiasaura nests, kids?"--and the bus becomes a time machine transporting the class back millions of years. They make stops in the Late Triassic Period, the Late Jurassic Period, the Late Cretaceous Period and, finally, the Cretaceous Period, where they discover a Maiasaura nesting ground. In exploring each era, the students examine various dinosaur species' habits and habitats, diets and physical characteristics. As always, Cole's text and Degen's art are fastidiously researched and exuberantly presented on creatively crowded pages.

No one doubted that Poul Plougmann had to go. Miserable Christmas sales were the last straw at the end of a terrible year -- Lego's revenues were down by 25 percent, and the company lost $230 million for the year, the worst in its history. What went so badly wrong? Chief executive Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the founder, explained it simply: Lego had "strayed too far from its roots and relied too heavily on merchandising spin-offs, such as Harry Potter figures, which proved unpopular this season despite the continuing success of J. K. Rowling's books." The solution? Lego announced that it would "return to basics." Kristiansen vowed: "We will focus on profitability, especially the attractive potential of our core products."</p><p>There's nothing especially remarkable about a story like this. Every day we read about companies that are doing well and someone gets promoted, and other companies that fail and someone gets the ax. Today it's Lego, and tomorrow it'll be someone else. The beat goes on.</p><p>Now, I'm really not very interested in Lego. As Rick might have said in <i>Casablanca,</i> the problems of one family-owned Danish toy maker don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. What does interest me is how we explain Lego's performance, because the way we think about what happened at Lego is typical of how we think about success or failure in countless other companies. We don't want to read just that Lego's sales were sharply down, we want an explanation of what happened. It can't just have been bad luck -- there must have been some reason why a proud company, a fixture on toy store shelves all around the world, a faithful playtime companion to generations of children, suddenly did so badly. So how did the business press explain Lego's downfall? A few newspapers reported that Lego was hurt by the fall of the U.S. dollar against the Danish kroner, which meant that North American sales -- about half of Lego's total -- were worth less on Lego's books. Some reporters also noted that a strong new rival, Montreal-based Mega Bloks Inc., was chipping away at Lego's dominant market share. But these were side issues. The main explanation for Lego's losses? <i>Lego had strayed from its core. It lost sight of its roots.</i> That's what Lego's chief executive said, and that's what the media reported, including the <i>Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal,</i> the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, <i>Nordic Business Report, Danish News Digest, Plastics News,</i> and about a dozen others. Depending on the source, Poul Plougmann was variously <i>sacked, fired, axed, ousted, removed, dismissed, replaced,</i> or simply <i>relieved of his duties.</i> But aside from the verb used to describe his departure, not much differed among the articles. Lego's big blunder was <i>straying from the core.</i></p><p>Consider for a moment the word <i>stray. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i> defines <i>to stray</i> as "to wander beyond established limits," "to deviate from a course that is regarded as right," and "to become lost." A guided missile can <i>stray off</i> course and hit the wrong target. A dog that runs away from home is called <i>a stray.</i> A company can <i>stray,</i> too, if it goes off on a foolish adventure, if it wanders off course, if it gets lost. Apparently that's what Lego did -- it chased merchandising spin-offs when it should have been focusing on its core product line. It strayed.</p><p>Chris Zook at Bain &amp; Company argued in his 2001 book, <i>Profit from the Core,</i> that companies often do best when they focus on relatively few products for a clear segment of customers. When companies get into very different products or go after very different sets of customers, the results often aren't pretty. But here's the catch: Exactly how do we define a company's core? Zook identifies no fewer than six dimensions along which a company can reasonably expand its activities -- into new geographies, new channels, new customer segments, new value chain steps, new businesses, and new products. Any one of them might be a sensible step into an adjacent area, radiating out from the core and bringing success. It's also possible that any one of them might be fraught with danger and lead to disaster. So how do we know which path to take? Where does the core end and where does straying off course begin? Of course, it's easy to know in retrospect -- but how can we know in advance?</p><p>Which brings us back to Lego. For years, our friends at Lego did just one thing: They manufactured and sold construction building blocks for children. That was the core. Lego made millions of blocks thanks to modern injection molding manufacturing techniques, it turned out blocks in plenty of different colors, and it made them in different shapes and sizes so they could be easily manipulated by little hands. Children could build just about anything out of Lego blocks -- the only limit was their imagination. Lego was always about construction building blocks, nothing else. It built a dominant market share and had huge power over distributors and retailers. In this segment, Lego was king.</p><p>Unfortunately, nothing in the business world stands still -- customer preferences change and technology marches on and new competitors appear. The market for traditional toys stagnated as kids shifted to electronic games at an earlier and earlier age. By the 1990s, simple plastic building blocks were a mature product and, in a world of video games and electronic toys, well, a bit <i>boring.</i> If Lego wanted to grow, or even if it wanted to stay the same size, it would have to try some new things -- the question was what. Of all the things Lego might try, what would make the most sense? If Lego decided to expand into, say, financial services, that would be straying from its core. No one would be surprised if the venture flopped -- <i>"What's a toy company doing trying to become a bank? What do they know about banking?"</i> -- and the responsible manager would have been removed without a second thought. What if Lego launched a line of children's clothing? That one's not so clear -- Lego knows a lot about kids, and it understands consumer products. It has plenty of power over retail distribution, just not in clothing, at least not yet. Maybe it could succeed, maybe not. What about <i>electronic</i> toys? Again, debatable -- maybe Lego could build on its experience in toys, and with all the growth in video games, why not? And in fact, Lego had developed Bionicle CD-ROM games and Mindstorm robots made of building blocks controlled by personal computers. But Harry Potter figures? Little toys with little plastic parts that snap together? That should be smack <i>inside</i> Lego's core. If Harry Potter figures are <i>outside</i> Lego's core, we ought to ask exactly how broad Lego's core really is. Because if Lego's core is nothing but traditional blocks, we'd have to wonder how it could possibly provide sufficient growth opportunities for a company with revenues of $2 billion.</p><p>In fact, Plougmann had been brought in from Bang &amp; Olufsen, a Danish maker of high-quality audio equipment, in part to go after new opportunities. His hiring was seen as a coup, symptomatic of Lego's commitment to new avenues of growth after the company posted its first loss ever in 1998. Under his guidance, Lego began to branch out into electronic toys and merchandising spin-offs, and the initial response was good. At the time, no one said Lego was moving outside its core. But when sales fell sharply in 2003, Kristiansen lost patience and pulled the plug on Poul Plougmann. "We have been pursuing a strategy based on growth by focusing on totally new products. This strategy did not give the expected results." So in 2004, Lego decided to "return to its core" and "focus on profitability." Strange, because profitable growth was presumably what Lego had in mind when it went after those new opportunities in the first place.</p><p>Imagine, if we could turn the clock back to 1999, that Lego had decided to stick to plastic building blocks, nothing more. Nope, we're not interested in a tie-in to Harry Potter, which was only the most popular children's book of all time, whose first two movies racked up box office receipts of $1.2 billion worldwide. Next year's headline? Probably something like this: executive sacked as lego sales flat. And the story line? Something like this: "Danish family firm stays too long with a mature product line and misses out on growth opportunities to more innovative rivals." Analysts will comment that Lego failed to go boldly forward. <i>It lacked vision. It was inward looking. Its managers were timid and complacent</i> -- or maybe even <i>arrogant.</i></p><p>Of course, some ventures outside the core are spectacularly successful. During the 1980s, General Electric, America's largest industrial company long associated with light bulbs, refrigerators, airplane engines, and plastics, sold some of its traditional businesses -- home appliances and televisions -- and went in a big way into financial services -- commercial finance, consumer finance, and insurance. Today, these financial services bring in more than 40 percent of GE's revenues and a corresponding amount of its profits, close to $8 billion. Did GE go beyond its core? Absolutely. But nobody called for the boss's head because GE was successful. In fact, GE was ranked at the top of <i>Fortune</i> magazine's 2005 survey of <i>Global Most Admired Companies,</i> ahead of Wal-Mart, Dell, Microsoft, and Toyota, and was ranked second in the <i>Financial Times's 2005 World's Most Respected Companies</i> survey, down one notch after six consecutive years at number one. So much for the perils of straying f...</p></p><h2>The Lost One: A Life of Peter Lorre</h2><p>Often typecast as a menacing figure, Peter Lorre achieved Hollywood fame first as a featured player and later as a character actor, trademarking his screen performances with a delicately strung balance between good and evil. His portrayal of the child murderer in Fritz Lang&#39;s masterpiece M (1931) catapulted him to international fame. Lang said of Lorre: &#34;He gave one of the best performances in film history and certainly the best in his life.&#34; Today, the Hungarian-born actor is also recognized for his riveting performances in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), The Maltese Falcon (1941), and Casablanca (1942). Lorre arrived in America in 1934 expecting to shed his screen image as a villain. He even tried to lose his signature accent, but Hollywood repeatedly cast him as an outsider who hinted at things better left unknown. Seeking greater control over his career, Lorre established his own production company. His unofficial &#34;graylisting&#34; by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, however, left him with little work. He returned to Germany, where he co-authored, directed, and starred in the film Der Verlorene (The Lost One) in 1951. German audiences rejected Lorre&#39;s dark vision of their recent past, and the actor returned to America, wearily accepting roles that parodied his sinister movie personality.The first biography of this major actor, The Lost One: A Life of Peter Lorre draws upon more than three hundred interviews, including conversations with directors Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, John Huston, Frank Capra, and Rouben Mamoulian, who speak candidly about Lorre, both the man and the actor. Author Stephen D. Youngkin examines for the first time Lorre&#39;s pivotal relationship with German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, his experience as an �migr� from Hitler&#39;s Germany, his battle with drug addiction, and his struggle with the choice between celebrity and intellectual respectability.Separating the enigmatic person from the persona long associated with one of classic Hollywood&#39;s most recognizable faces, The Lost One is the definitive account of a life triumphant and yet tragically riddled with many failed possibilities.</p><p><b>Stephen D. Youngkin</b> is coauthor of <i>The Films of Peter Lorre </i>and <i>Peter Lorre: Portrait des Schauspielers auf der Flucht.</i> He appeared as an expert biographer on the German television documentary <i>Das Doppelte Gesicht</i> (The Double Face) and A&amp;E's <i>Biography</i> tribute to Peter Lorre."Winner of the 2005 Rondo Hatton Award"&#x2015;<i>Winner of the Best Book of 2005 in the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards</i><p>"Finalist for the 2005 Theater Library Association Award."</p><p>"Youngkin gets behind the image to incise a definitive portrait, and Lorre becomes a likeness we can like in-depth."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i></p><p>"Youngkin's massively researched opus, drawing on over 300 interviews he conducted, lives up to the task of conveying Lorre's personal tragedy. . . . Readably written, spiced up with occasionally very amusing anecdotes, acerbic asides and insightful conclusions."&#x2015;<i>Cineaste</i></p><p>"The colossal assemblage of research has been whipped into a compelling biographical narrative."&#x2015;<i>Filmmonthly</i></p><p>"Youngkin makes a strong case for Lorre as one of cinema's most underrated actors, exploring in detail his early stage work in Europe, his largely forgotten performances in radio and television, and of course his role as the child murderer in Fritz Lang's classic crime film M, which would forever define Lorre as a celluloid bogeyman."&#x2015;<i>Florida Newspaper</i></p><p>"Youngkin peels back the layers of Lorre's life to reveal a fascinating, nuanced individual who struggled with intellectual issues in the midst of glamour and fame."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></p><p>"As the very first biography of Lorre, The Lost One does not disappoint. . . . A welcome revelation indeed."&#x2015;<i>MovieMaker</i></p><p>"Youngkin's life of Lorre is a monumental piece of research and sheds new light on a career that has too long been ignored and undervalued."&#x2015;<i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i></p><p>"You couldn't ask for a better book about Lorre. It will become the single most important book about Lorre's life and career, without question."&#x2015;<i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>"[The book] is one of the finest biographies of an actor ever written, on a par with Patricia Bosworth's Montgomery Clift and Charles Winecoff's Split Image: The Life of Andy Perkins."&#x2015;Herbert Shadrack, <i>www.cinemaretro.com</i></p><p>"A good book on an important film figure [who] certainly deserves this exhaustive look at his life and</p><p>career."&#x2015;<i>Great Old Movies</i></p></p><h2>The Jennifer Morgue</h2><p><p>Bob Howard&#x2014;a T-shirt&#x2013;wearing computer geek and&nbsp;field agent&nbsp;for the super-secret&nbsp;British government agency The Laundry&#x2014;must save the world from eldritch horrors, codenamed&nbsp;Jennifer Morgue,&nbsp;in this fast-paced spy thriller.

In 1975, the CIA used Howard Hughes's <i>Glomar Explorer</i> in a bungled attempt to raise a sunken Soviet submarine in order to access the Jennifer Morgue, an occult device that allows communication with the dead. Now a ruthless billionaire intends to try again, even if by doing so he awakens the Great Old Ones, who thwarted the earlier expedition. It's up to Bob and a collection of British eccentrics even Monty Python would consider odd to stop the bad guy and save the world, while getting receipts for all expenditures or else face the most dreaded menace of all: the Laundry's own auditors. Stross has a marvelous time making eldritch horror appear commonplace in the face of bureaucracy. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As New in DJ.</p><p>This collection of 29 stories, Bond's second Arkham collection after Nightmares and Daydreams (1968), stands as a sparkling tribute to one of the greats, now 93 years old, of SF and fantasy. Bond says that he prefers the latter, because "fantasy is tongue-in-cheek, but there's nothing funny about hardware!" Humor, not surprisingly, is the keynote of these tales, which are divided into five thematic sections, each with a brief introduction by the author (one wishes these intros were longer). The section entitled "Family Circle" features Bond's favorite series characters: Lancelot Biggs, Pat Pending, Squaredeal Sam McGhee and the incomparable Lobblies (two invisible creatures who accompany Henry Mergenthwirker and correctly predict the future with unpredictable results). Nearly all the stories date from the WWII era, and since Bond has chosen not to do any rewriting, the book, like one of his typical time-travel yarns, serves as a nostalgic trip to the past. The Dodgers still play baseball (badly) in Brooklyn in "Herman and the Mermaid"; the old Pennsylvania Station, even in ruins, awes the "Jinnian" travelers from a postapocalyptic future in "Magic City." The quintessential Virginia gentleman, Bond is at heart a New Yorker, and he nicely captures the city's accent. Edd Cartier's illustration from Unknown Worlds for the concluding story, "Occupation: Demigod," makes the perfect frontispiece. An earlier, more wholesome America lovingly emerges from these pages. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flower Fairies of the Spring</h2><p>Book by Barker, Cicely Mary</p><p></p><h2>That&#39;s Not My Fox ...(Usborne Touchy-Feely Books)</h2><p>The next title in an internationally bestselling series, which includes more than forty titles and has sold millions of copies worldwide.

To secure her freedom and save her daughters, Cristiana must use a secret entrusted to her by her husband as he was dying - a secret that could bring down those lords nearest the king and destroy those most dear to her.<br> <br> Dame Frevisse of St. Frideswide's nunnery must decide where her loyalties lies - to the crown, to the truth, or to England's peace. And whatever she chooses, in the end her help may be of little use against the ruthless men threatened by the secret on which all of Cristiana's hopes depend...<br> <br> <i>"The suspense builds steadily ... in this well-wrought tale involving murder, treason, and 'layers of ambition and betrayal'." - Publishers Weekly<br> <br> "[Frazer] uses many real historical persons in her books, deftly and flawlessly weaving them into the story. Her fictitious characters are also well-defined, and Cristiana will break the reader's heart." - Romantic Times</i></p><p>Margaret Frazer was a finalist for an Edgar(r) Award for best original paperback for <i>The Servant's Tale</i> and <i>The Prioress' Tale</i>.Don't be discouraged by a confusing hawk-hunting scene introducing numerous characters at the start of Frazer's 14th Dame Frevisse mystery (after 2004's <i>The Hunter's Tale</i>), because what follows is a smooth and absorbing saga of conspiracy and treachery in 15th-century England. In 1449, landowner Edward Helyngton lies on his deathbed while his jealous cousin Laurence waits raptor-like to swoop down and seize his estate. Soon after Edward's demise, his widow, Cristiana, is banished to St. Frideswide's nunnery, where she's forced to do penance face down on the cold chapel floor for unspecified sins alleged by Laurence's agents. Living on bread and water, the embittered Cristiana eventually tells her sad tale to Dame Frevisse, who is at first only a sympathetic listener, but later takes a more active sleuthing role. A tantalizing secret confided to Cristiana by her dying husband turns out to have stunning political implications. The suspense builds steadily toward a visit from King Henry VI in this well-wrought tale involving murder, treason and "layers of ambition and betrayal."

Burt Spiller is a fisherman&#39;?&#39; The surprise is understandable, for in none of his six previously published books did &#39;the poet laureate of the ruffled grouse&#39; reveal himself in any other guise than hunter. But in fact, as his great friend and gunning partner Tap Tapply writes in the foreword, &#39;he cast a fly well and played a trout deftly, even though his attention was likely to wander if he heard the piping of a sparrow, and I have seen him stop fishing altogether to sit and watch a muskrat.&#39; Tapply&#39;s comment tells us much, both about the book and about the great gentleman who sent it off to a publisher just shortly before his death. Spiller&#39;s accompanying note diffidently described the manuscript as &#39;glimpses of Canada, Nova Scotia and Maine, with a little fishing....It is vignettes.&#39; So it is, but it is also pure Spiller, with all his honesty, grace, humor and sensitivity, in waders instead of in brush pants. Perhaps it can&#39;t be termed typical Spiller -- there would have to be dogs and birds for that -- but it is nonetheless essential to a rounded portrait of the man and a comprehensive appreciation of his work. Fishin&#39; Around is perhaps the only Spiller work that is capable of revealing to the non-shooting outdoorsman the full measure of the qualities that have established Spiller&#39;s upland books as classics. And for his legion of staunch admirers, whether they are anglers or not, this handsome final volume is a worthy companion to Grouse Feathers, Firelight, Thoroughbred and the rest.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Deacon I Want to Be: Growing in Faith, Faithful in Service; Member Book</h2><p>A Bible study that helps current and prospective deacons grow spiritually and serve faithfully in the local church.

His bulging car fronts evoke sexual hunger, while his revolving doors ache with anonymity, causing some critics to dub his style "Post-Pop." Empty subway cars and gleaming city streets devoid of people suggest a world where material values have overpowered human beings. In this laudatory monograph, New York City art dealer Meisel wants us to believe that Estes is a great Realist painter, not to be pigeonholed as a Photorealist, but by emphasizing the paintings' technique over their social meaning, he weakens his argument. When Estes applies his Hyperrealism to vistas of Florence and Venice, the essential sterility of his method becomes evident. At their best, his slick paintings comment on the way the mind's focusing imposes patterns on the way we see things. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The work of premier photorealist painter Richard Estes receives its first book length treatment in this monograph. New York art dealer Meisel provides a synopsis of Estes's work and illustrates all of his known paintings from the past 20 years. An essay by Perreault, which forms the bulk of the text, argues for Estes's place in the tradition of high art masters and decries Estes's detractors as being unreasonably hostile to representational art, the use of photographs by painters, or both. The reproductions in this volume are excellent and will appeal to a broad audience including general readers, informed laypersons, and specialists.

In 1953, Zell Miller was as low as he could get. He'd dropped out of college after being made to feel inferior because of his "hillbilly" background and wound up in jail one weekend after getting drunk on moonshine and driving his car into a ditch. In an effort to turn his life around, he signed up for marine boot camp. The experience changed his life, and he remains convinced that the values he learned during his 90 days at Parris Island are "the only basis upon which diversity can coexist with commonality and all people can pursue individual goals for themselves while contributing to the general well-being and advancement of society as a whole." These simple values, from neatness and punctuality to discipline and loyalty, are for Miller the basis of a strong civil society. Although some readers may find some of his notions--such as his frustration at seeing kids wear caps backwards--a bit extreme, Miller reminds us that any organization that pumped out men like Bernard Shaw, Don Imus, Ted Williams, and Art Buchwald must have <i>something</i> going for it."When it comes to politics and politicians, we don't agree on much, but one thing we do agree on is that Gov. Zell Miller is a helluva man and he has written a helluva book!"<br>--James Carville and Mary Matalin<br> <br><i>"Corps Values</i> touches at the core of what has made America great."<br>--Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House of Representatives<p>"Gov.

Livingston, Jr., Major General, USMC (Ret.), Medal of Honor winner</p><p>"As a brother Marine, it's easy to see why Zell Miller has been so successful. He has hit a grand slam with this book." <br>--Ted Williams, Baseball Hall of Famer</p></p><h2>Thyroid Mind Power: The Proven Cure for Hormone-Related Depression, Anxiety, and Memory Loss</h2><p>One in ten Americans has some degree of thyroid imbalance, and even mild imbalances can cause mental and emotional symptoms.&nbsp;<i>Thyroid Mind Power</i>pinpoints the connection between thyroid imbalance and conditions such as depression, anxiety, irritability, and more, offering hope for millions who are suffering from improper diagnosis and medication.

Many doctors, nurses, health administrators, health insurers, psychologists, counselors, pharmacists, and other providers consider that treating a person's body has very little to do with his mind, and that treating the mind hardly impacts the body. The sad result of this thinking is that we now have specialists and medicines for mental problems, plus separate providers and drugs for physical challenges.<br><br>This artificial separation leaves a huge number of hormonally challenged people trapped. Doctors give them medicines for physical symptoms, psychiatrists give them medicines for mental symptoms, and each ignores the hormonal action at the interface of physical and mental. This is unacceptable for the millions experiencing mental challenges due to their physical hormonal condition.<br><br>Our culture is looking for quick fixes, but not in the right places. Today's medical system readily employs mind-altering drugs to change our behavior or mood. In many instances, however, this quick fix is not the optimal solution for the longer haul.<br><br>In addition to fixing symptoms, we must also make advances in treating the root cause of the condition. Otherwise, many will be doomed to ingest heavy pharmacologic drugs for the rest of their lives.<br><br>Surely many of our pharmacologic advances are brilliant and can be helpful when we face crises. Not everyone, however, can afford these costly drugs, and those who can might eventually need other drugs that could interfere with them and cause major problems.<br><br>Unless we are attempting to replace something the body normally makes but is deficient in (due to sluggish production), or unless we are facing critical illness without the daily ingestion of a medication, it is unlikely to be healthy to take pharmacologic medications forever. Not only do we consider it perhaps unhealthy, but also we often consider it overkill.<br><br>Adopting a Perspective of Wholeness<br><br>Our goal with our patients has always been to help them gain more confidence in their abilities to heal their own personal pain, to help them minimize the expression of physical pain that can often have psychological underpinnings, and to help them learn to express themselves clearly and effectively.<br><br>Our previous books about the thyroid have encouraged people to use their illnesses as an opportunity to learn to heal themselves fully--body, mind, and spirit. We choose to honor the interconnections that make us whole.<br><br>Keep in mind that we were young practitioners during the holistic movement of the early 1970s, when the concepts of whole-person treatment were being developed in our country, starting mostly in California, where we live.

In the mid-1970s, Karilee developed a holistic nursing program there, implementing the concepts of integrative care.<br><br>We spend quality time with our patients, inspiring them through our words and personal stories to try our new ways of living. We help them to break free of their fears and to dissociate from the projected fears of their doctors and others less informed. We inspire them to use their own beliefs and intuition in approaching their health challenges. Our central belief honors each person as absolutely the best healer for his or her own health situation. Our way of viewing our patients has been informed by decades of study in sociology, psychology, anthropology and cultural awareness, human behavior, endocrinology, neurology, general medicine, nursing, religion, and various other systems.<br><br>Having spent decades thinking as whole-person health professionals, we believe that many of our patients' emotional challenges are best viewed through the hormonal lens. Along with hormone balancing, we have consistently encouraged habit changes coupled with new ways of thinking.<br><br>When our first thyroid book came out in 2000, people attending our book signings were upset that we were directing people to get better care from their doctors, because their doctors did not know how to do a good job on thyroid boosting. We realize, sadly, that our way of thinking may not yet be shared by the majority of our colleagues. And herein lies the greater challenge.<br><br>A Look at the Science<br><br>We don't want to bog you down with a lot of jargon and academic research, but we feel that the best health consumers are educated consumers. With that in mind, we've included a few select research studies in each chapter, with the full reference listed in a chapter-by-chapter list at the end of the book. If you are not interested, feel free to browse forward to the next section.<br><br>. The prevalence of thyroid conditions runs from about 5% to almost 25% of the population being studied. While thyroid imbalance is a very common condition among women, men also have thyroid problems, though far less often. (Feit) . Thyroid problems also become more common as we age. The numbers of postmenopausal women who have some degree of thyroid abnormality ranged up to 26% in a 2001 study published in the prestigious Journal of Epidemiology. . In the early 2000s, the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York estimated that more than 20 million people in the United States were currently taking thyroid medicine. At the time, this figure was believed to be higher than that of all people taking diabetes and cancer medicine combined. (Ditkoff) . Professor Chester Ridgeway at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center tested more than 25,000 normal people, finding that a surprising percentage of them actually had a hidden thyroid condition. His calculations allowed him to estimate that another 13 million Americans with some degree of hypothyroidism would be detected by simply having a TSH test. (Ridgeway) . In 2002 the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published information suggesting that many more people would be properly diagnosed, if only the TSH tests were interpreted using accurate normal ranges. At that time, the old TSH range (from 0.5 to 5.5) was changed to 0.3 to 3.0 by the AACE. This means that Dr. Ridgeway's estimates of 13 million might actually involve 20 million or more people who would find that they have some degree of thyroid problem, if they were only TSH tested. . Also in 2001, the Rotterdam studies showed that having a thyroid condition was a separate, independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. This study underscored the importance of a thyroid problem not only as a mild incidental illness but also as a condition that could affect and worsen other serious conditions. (Hofman)<br><br>What Do These Statistics Tell Us?<br><br>. Thyroid conditions are among the most common ailments today. . In any given population, thyroid problems are epidemic. . Those who know that they have thyroid issues represent only half of those who actually do have the condition. . Thyroid problems exist in a variety of mild early forms, very difficult to detect. . Standard screening tests reveal severe forms of high and low thyroid, but they are not sufficiently able to reveal milder forms. . Millions of people suffer every day with symptoms that could be a common sign of thyroid problems. Since most doctors are not curious about the thyroid connection, you must be your own advocate for your best treatment.<br><br>In the late 2000s other studies began appearing, showing that even mild forms of high and low thyroid are actually clinically significant (see Appendix). It was then realized that you could have very mild thyroid imbalance and still have a tremendously difficult problem as a result of that mild medical condition.<br><br>The Many Faces of Thyroid Problems<br><br>Most people think of low thyroid as a small problem, causing a weight issue or making the person chilly or tired. This attitude, sadly, allows most thyroid problems today to remain undiagnosed and poorly treated. Now, with the work of a newly forming Coalition for Better Thyroid Care, we are moving toward a more comprehensive understanding of the poor misunderstood thyroid gland.<br><br>. Severe forms of thyroid disorder can cause physical collapse, hospitalization, and coma. . Milder forms of the condition commonly cause fatigue, overweight, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, constipation, heart irregularity, dry hair, dry skin, dry eyes, hair thinning or hair loss, and thin, cracking, or peeling nails. . A wide range of female problems can result from thyroid malfunction, including menstrual irregularity, endometriosis, infertility, recurrent miscarriage, birth defects, and terrible menopause.<br><br>Specifically, those contending with a high thyroid must learn to recognize the following symptoms, which can include bulging eyes; intense, staring gaze; fast pulse; irregular or skipped heartbeats; swollen, tender thyroid gland; breathlessness; feeling too hot for no reason; and nondiet-related weight loss, often with increased appetite and loose bowels.<br><br>To com�d this dilemma, any of these problems could exist alone, or mixed in with other symptoms. The symptoms can be intermittent and mild, or they can be ongoing and severe. Thyroid problems express themselves with a tremendous variability. In many cases, this can present challenges for harried doctors who don't have the resources to spend hours interviewing their patients. Many people with thyroid problems walk out of their doctor's office with a prescription for an antidepressant. Too many women are being misdiagnosed and under-treated for simple thyroid issues that could be easily fixed. Thyroid imbalance, present today in epidemic proportions, commonly also causes psychological symptoms, ranging from mildly annoying behaviors to severe psychiatric disturbances. (Patrick)<br><br>Introducing the Thyroid Brain<br><br>Thyroid disease is one illness that is known to cause physical as well as mental symptoms.<br><br>Even mild low thyroid can cause severe physical problems and severe mental problems.<br><br>These mental symptoms occur because of particular ways that the thyroid affects brain chemistry. It is absolutely remarkable how essential the thyroid is to normal brain function.<br><br>The brain uses thyroid differently--and more eagerly--than other tissues do. In fact, according to Ridha Arem, MD, author of The Thyroid Solution: "It is time for thyroid hormones to be recognized as key brain chemicals, whose actions and effects are similar in many ways to serotonin and other neuro-transmitters." (Arem)<br><br>According to Dr. Arem, an endocrinology professor and medical journal editor, thyroid disease often remains undiagnosed for an inexcusably long time. Dr. Arem writes, "Millions of people suffer needlessly while their doctors continue to treat thyroid dysfunction as a simple physical disorder rather than what it is: a complex blow to the body and the mind."<br><br>Dr. Arem expresses concern that psychiatrists far too often are likely to come up with a psychiatric diagnosis when examining a thyroid patient. "Often, psychiatrists do not perform a detailed enough physical examination, or a complete enough panel of lab tests, that might lead them to detect physical causes for the mental symptoms."<br><br>Dr. Arem is not alone in his beliefs. A major article for General Hospital Psychiatry describes the following study (Kathol):<br><br>In a group of hyperthyroid patients seen by psychiatrists, almost half were diagnosed with depression, or anxiety disorder. These patients did not have anxiety or depression however; what they had were the mental symptoms of hyperthyroidism.<br><br>If trained psychiatrists are making this misdiagnosis, just imagine how many general practitioners, internists, busy clinic doctors, and urgent care doctors might make this same kind of mistake.</p><h2>Ice!</h2><p>Jones recounts how his attempt to set a world&#39;s record for the northernmost geographical penetration by a solo-manned sailing craft led to his being trapped in the middle of an ice pack in the Arctic Ocean where he was forced to confront loneliness, despair, and death</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesTristan Jones is one of the best-known authors of sailing stories writing today.

Attuned to the moon, they rose before first light to board wooden shrimp boats and head slowly out across black water, the heavy green nets poised like folded wings. Tales of the sea were whispered to them in their mothers' laps, they earned their sea legs as they learned to walk, and they labored on the boats soon after. Shrimping was all they knew or ever wanted to know. It was in their blood.</p><p>Bud Morrison opened his eyes and pushed back the thin cotton blanket. Shafts of gray light through the shutters cast a ragged pattern against the wall. He groaned and shifted his weight in an awkward swing to sit at the edge of his bed, head bent, feet on the floor. His was a seaman's body -- hard-weathered and scarred. He scratched his jaw, his head, his belly, a morning ritual, waking slowly in the leaden light. Then, with another sigh, he stiffly rose. His knees creaked louder than the bedsprings, and he winced at aches and pains so old he'd made peace with them. Standing, he could turn his bad knee to let it slip back into place with a small <i>pop</i>.</p><p>A salty wind whistled through the open window, fluttering the pale curtains. Bud walked across the wood floor to peer out at the sky. He scowled when he saw shadowy, fingerlike clouds clutching the moon in a hazy grip.</p><p>"Wind's blowin'."</p><p>Bud turned toward the voice. Carolina lay on her belly on their bed, her head to the side facing an open palm. Her eyes were still closed.</p><p>"Not too bad," he replied in a gravelly voice.</p><p>She stirred, raising her hand to swipe a lock of hair from her face. "I'll make your breakfast." She raised herself on her elbows, her voice resigned.</p><p>"Nah, you sleep."</p><p>His stomach rumbled, and he wondered if he was some kind of fool for not nudging his wife to get up and make him his usual breakfast of pork sausage and biscuits. Lord knew his father never gave his mother a day off from work. Or his kids, for that matter. Not during shrimping season. But he was not his father, and Carolina had a bad tooth that had kept her tossing and turning half the night. She didn't want to spend money they didn't have to see the dentist, but the pain was making her hell on wheels to live with, and in the end, she'd have to go anyway.</p><p>He'd urged her to go but she'd refused. It infuriated Bud that she wouldn't, because it pointed to his inability to provide basic services for his family. This tore him up inside, a feeling only another man would understand.</p><p>They'd had words about it the night before. He shook his head and let the curtain drop. Man, that woman could be stubborn. No, he thought, he'd rather have a little peace than prickly words this morning.</p><p>"I'm only going out for one haul," he told her. "Back by noon, latest."</p><p>"Be careful out there," she replied with a muffled yawn as she buried her face back into the pillows.</p><p>He stole a moment to stare at the ample curves of her body under the crumpled sheet. There was a time he'd crawl back into the scented warmth of the bed he'd shared with Carolina for more than thirty years. Even after all that time, there was something about the turn of her chin, the roundness of her shoulders, and the earthy, fulsome quality of her beauty that still caused his body to stir. Carolina's red hair was splayed out across the pillow, and in the darkness he couldn't see the slender streaks of gray that he knew distressed her. Carolina was not one for hair color or makeup, and Bud liked her natural, so the gray stayed. Lord knew his own hair was turning gray, he thought, running his hand over his scalp as he headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Bud took pride in being a clean man. His hands might be scraped, his fingernails broken and discolored, but they were scrubbed. Nothing fancy or scented. He tugged the gold band from his ring finger, then slipped it on a gold chain and fastened it around his neck. He didn't wear his ring on his hand on the boat, afraid it would get caught in the machinery. The cotton pants and shirt he slipped on were scrupulously laundered, but no matter what Carolina tried, she couldn't get rid of the stains. Or the stink of fish. This was the life they'd chosen.</p><p>As he brushed his teeth, he thought the face that stared back at him looked older than his fifty-seven years. A lifetime of salt and sea had navigated a deep course across his weathered face. Long lines from the eyes down to his jaw told tales of hard hours under a brutal sun. A quick smile brightened his eyes like sunshine on blue water. Carolina always told him she loved the sweet smell of shrimp on his body. It had taken her years to get used to it, but in time she'd said it made her feel safe. He spat out the toothpaste and wiped his smile with the towel. What a woman his Carolina was. God help him, he still loved her, he thought, tossing the towel in the hamper and cutting off the light.</p><p>Carolina's face was dusky in the moonlight. He walked to the bedside and bent to kiss her cheek good-bye, then paused, held in check by the stirring of an old resentment. The distance to her cheek felt too far. Sighing, he drew back. Instead, he lifted the sheet higher over her shoulders. Soundlessly, he closed the door.</p><p>He rubbed his aching knee as he made his way down the ancient stairs. The old house was dark, but he didn't need a light to navigate his way through the narrow halls. White Gables had been in Carolina's family since 1897 in a town founded by her ancestors. When they weren't working on the boat, they were working to infuse new life into the aged frame house, repairing costly old woodwork and heart pine floors, fighting an interminable battle against salt, moisture, and termites. His father often chided him about it, telling him it was like throwing more sand on a beach eaten away by a strong current. In his heart, Bud knew the old man was right, but Carolina loved the house and the subject of leaving it was moot. Even in the dim light, he saw evidence of it in the shine of the brass doorknobs, the sparkle of the windows, and the neat arrangement of the inherited threadbare sofa and chairs. Every morning when he walked through the silent old house, he was haunted by the worry that he'd cause Carolina to be the last of her family to live here.</p><p>Bud went straight to the kitchen and opened the fridge. He leaned against the cool metal, staring in, searching for whatever might spark his appetite. With a sigh he grabbed a six-pack and shut the door. The breakfast of champions, he thought as he popped open a can of beer. The cool brew slaked his thirst, waking him further. Then he grabbed a few ingredients from the pantry and tossed them in a brown bag: onions, garlic, potatoes, grits, coffee. Pee Dee would cook up a seaman's breakfast later, after the haul. He added the rest of the beer.</p><p>At the door he stuck his feet into a pair of white rubber boots, stuffing his pants tightly inside the high rims. The Red Ball boots with their deep-grooved soles and high tops were uniform for shrimpers. They did the job of keeping him sure-footed on a rolling deck and prevented small crabs from creeping in. He rose stiffly, rubbing the small of his back. Working on the water took its toll on a man's body with all the falls, twists, and heavy lifting.</p><p>"Stop complaining, old woman," he scolded himself. "The sun won't wait." He scooped up the brown bag from the table, flipped a cap onto his head, and headed out of the house.</p><p>The moon was a sliver in the dark sky and his heels crunched loudly along the gravel walkway. Several ancient oaks, older than the house, lined their property along Pinckney Street. Their low-hanging branches lent a note of melancholy.</p><p>The air was soft this early in the morning. Cooler. The rise and fall of insects singing in the thick summer foliage sounded like a jungle chorus. He got in his car and drove a few blocks along narrow streets. McClellanville was a small, quaint village along the coast of South Carolina between Charleston and Myrtle Beach. There had once been many similar coastal towns from North Carolina to Florida, back when shrimping was king and a man could make a good living for his family. In his own lifetime, Bud had seen shrimping villages disappear as the value of coastal land skyrocketed and the cost of local shrimp plummeted. Docks were sold and the weathered shrimp boats were replaced by glossy pleasure boats. Local families who'd fished these waters for generations moved on. Bud wondered how much longer McClellanville could hold on.</p><p>His headlights carved a swath through the inky darkness, revealing the few cars and pickup trucks of captains and crews parked in the lot. He didn't see Pee Dee's dilapidated Ford. Bud sighed and checked the clock on his dashboard. It was 4:30 a.m. Where the hell was that sorry excuse for a deckhand?</p><p>He followed the sound of water slapping against the shore and the pungent smell of diesel fuel, salt, and rotting fish toward the dock. Drawing close, he breathed deep and felt the stirring of his fisherman's blood. He felt more at home here on the ramshackle docks than in his sweet-smelling house on Pinckney Street. Gone were the tourists, the folks coming to buy local shrimp, and the old sailors who hung around retelling stories. In the wee hours of morning, the docks were quiet save for the fishermen working with fevered intensity against the dawn. Lights on the trawlers shone down on the rigging, colored flags, and bright trim, lending the docks an eerie carnival appearance.</p><p>His heels reverberated on the long avenue of rotting wood and tilting pilings that ran over mudflats spiked with countless oysters. Bud passed two trawlers -- the <i>Village Lady</i> and the <i>Miss Georgia</i>, their engines already churning the water. He quickened his step. The early bird catches the worm, he thought, lifting his hand in a wave. Buster Gay, a venerable captain and an old mate, returned the wave with his free hand, eyes intent on his work.</p><p>There were fewer boats docked every year, d...</p></p><h2>James Baldwin: A Biography</h2><p>Provides an incisive look inside the complex life of the twentieth-century&#39;s most influential black writer, discussing his extraordinary literary works, his homosexuality, and his struggle against white society&#39;s denial of African-American identity. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>David Adams Leeming is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.This fourth life of writer James Baldwin won't give a bad name to authorized biographies, but neither will it elevate the suspect genre to new heights. Leeming (English/Univ. of Connecticut) met Baldwin in 1961. By then, Baldwin was perhaps the best-known and most widely read living black writer in the United States. Their meeting place was Istanbul, where Leeming was teaching and Baldwin was visiting a friend. Although Leeming's presence in this biography is minimal- -even in the Turkish chapters--his professional and social relationship with Baldwin grew rapidly. He was designated authorized biographer and granted access to Baldwin's private papers in 1977, ten years before Baldwin's death at 63. Throughout the text, Leeming seems to struggle with his official status; he slips into the various roles of friend, sycophant, defender, and personal secretary. The alternate references to ``Jimmy'' and the more formal ``Baldwin'' give the book a split personality. Despite this schizophrenic tone, this biography has value as a life chronicle. After all, Leeming saw and heard a great deal that previous Baldwin biographers had no opportunity to see or hear. Leeming deals extensively with Baldwin's precarious (and shifting) place on the racial divide, with his homosexuality, and with the mental instability that led to suicide attempts. Leeming does a workmanlike job of portraying Baldwin's Harlem childhood, the writing of the early books, Go Tell It on the Mountain and Giovanni's Room (among others), the search across the world for a country to call home, and much more. The book is rich in detail but not overly long. Baldwin's life was so inherently fascinating that only a hack could make it dull. Leeming is no hack. But, despite Baldwin's labeling of Leeming as ``my Boswell,'' the biographer is clearly not that, either. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The United States Declaration of Independence asserted that all human beings are created equally and endowed by society with the unquestionable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In practice, however, these rights are often limited to the majority, the rich, or the property owners. Sociocracy ensures these rights to everyone, and in the process, makes profit-making businesses more profitable and non-profit organizations more effective. Using consent and collaboration as a foundation for decision-making and communications, it builds a strong governance structure that extends from the mailroom to the boardroom and from the client to the funders. Using the new sciences of cybernetics, systems thinkng, and complexity theory, it creates organizations that are as powerful, self-organizing, and self-correcting as the natural world</p><p><p>This is the first book on sociocracy by native English speaking authors and the first to place sociocracy in the context of the historical development of governance and management theory. While it presents the theoretical foundations and history of sociocratic principles and methods, it also contains extensive "how to" information.</p>John Buck was the first native English-speaking consultant certified by the Sociocratisch Centrum in Rotterdam to teach and guide implementation of the sociocratic circle organization method. After he learned to read Dutch to gain full access to the literature and to study at the Sociocratisch Centrum, Buck has helped translate a number of key documents from the Dutch. With a BA from Brown University, he later completed an MA in Quantitative Sociology at George Washington University in order to measure the effects of sociocracy on Dutch workers. His thesis confirmed the effectiveness of the sociocratic method in increasing worker commitment to their companies.

The accused is the unimpeachable Sir Hugo Drax, head of the multi-million-pound Moonraker missile programme on which Britain&#39;s future depends.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><b>1. SECRET PAPERWORK </b> <p>The two thirty-eights roared simultaneously.</p> <p>The walls of the underground room took the crash of sound and batted it to and fro between them until there was silence. James Bond watched the smoke being sucked from each end of the room towards the central Ventaxia fan. The memory in his right hand of how he had drawn and fired with one sweep from the left made him confident. He broke the chamber sideways out of the Colt Detective Special and waited, his gun pointing at the floor, while the Instructor walked the twenty yards towards him through the half-light of the gallery.</p> <p>Bond saw that the Instructor was grinning. 'I don't believe it,' he said. 'I got you that time.'</p> <p>The Instructor came up with him. 'I'm in hospital, but you're dead, sir,' he said. In one hand he held the silhouette target of the upper body of a man. In the other a polaroid film, postcard size. He handed this to Bond and they turned to a table behind them on which there was a green-shaded desk-light and a large magnifying glass.</p> <p>Bond picked up the glass and bent over the photograph. It was a flash-light photograph of him. Around his right hand there was a blurred burst of white flame. He focused the glass carefully on the left side of his dark jacket. In the centre of his heart there was a tiny pinpoint of light.</p> <p>Without speaking, the Instructor laid the big white man-shaped target under the lamp. Its heart was a black bullseye, about three inches across. Just below and half an inch to the right was the rent made by Bond's bullet.</p> <p>'Through the left wall of the stomach and out at the back,' said the Instructor, with satisfaction. He took out a pencil and scribbled an addition on the side of the target.' Twenty rounds and I make it you owe me seven-and-six, sir,' he said impassively.</p> <p>Bond laughed. He counted out some silver. 'Double the stakes next Monday,' he said. 'That's all right with me,' said the Instructor. 'But you can't beat the machine, sir. And if you want to get into the team for the Dewar Trophy we ought to give the thirty-eights a rest and spend some time on the Remington. That new long twenty-two cartridge they've just brought out is going to mean at least 7900 out of a possible 8000 to win. Most of your bullets have got to be in the X-ring and that's only as big as a shilling when it's under your nose. At a hundred yards it isn't there at all.'</p> <p>'To hell with the Dewar Trophy,' said Bond. 'It's your money I'm after.' He shook the unfired bullets in the chamber of his gun into his cupped hand and laid them and the gun on the table.' See you Monday. Same time ?'</p> <p>'Ten O'clock'11 be fine, sir,' said the Instructor, jerking down the two handles on the iron door. He smiled at Bond's back as it disappeared up the steep concrete stairs leading to the ground floor. He was pleased with Bond's shooting, but he wouldn't have thought of telling him that he was the best shot in the Service. Only M was allowed to know that, and his Chief of Staff, who would be told to enter the scores of that day's shoot on Bond's Confidential Record.</p> <p>Bond pushed through the green baize door at the top of the basement steps and walked over to the lift that would take him up to the eighth floor of the tall, grey building near Regent's Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service. He was satisfied with his score but not proud of it. His trigger finger twitched in his pocket as he wondered how to conjure up that little extra flash of speed that would beat the machine, the complicated box of tricks that sprung the target for just three seconds, fired back at him with a blank .38, and shot a pencil of light aimed at him and photographed it as he stood and fired from the circle of chalk on the floor.</p> <p>The lift doors sighed open and Bond got in. The liftman could smell the cordite on him. They always smelled like that when they came up from the shooting gallery. He liked it. It reminded him of the Army. He pressed the button for the eighth and rested the stump of his left arm against the control handle.</p> <p>If only the light was better, thought Bond. But M insisted that all shooting should be done in averagely bad conditions. A dim light and a target that shot back at you was as close as he could get to copying the real thing. 'Shooting hell out of apiece of cardboard doesn't prove anything' was his single-line introduction to the Small-arms Defence Manual.</p> <p>The lift eased to a stop and as Bond stepped out into the drab Ministry-of-Works-green corridor and into the bustling world of girls carrying files, doors opening and shutting, and muted telephone bells, he emptied his mind of all thoughts of his shoot and prepared himself for the normal business of a routine day at Headquarters.</p> <p>He walked along to the end door on the right. It was as anonymous as all the others he had passed. No numbers. If you had any business on the eighth floor, and your office was not on that floor, someone would come and fetch you to the room you needed and see you back into the lift when you were through.</p> <p>Bond knocked and waited. He looked at his watch. Eleven o'clock. Mondays were hell. Two days of dockets and files to plough through. And week-ends were generally busy times abroad. Empty flats got burgled. People were photographed in compromising positions. Motorcar 'accidents' looked better, got a more cursory handling, amidst the week-end slaughter on the roads. The weekly bags from Washington, Istanbul, and Tokyo would have come in and been sorted. They might hold something for him.</p> <p>The door opened and he had his daily moment of pleasure at having a beautiful secretary. 'Morning, Lil,' he said.</p> <p>The careful warmth other smile of welcome dropped about ten degrees.</p> <p>'Give me that coat,' she said. 'It stinks of cordite. And don't call me Lil. You know I hate it.'</p> <p>Bond took off his coat and handed it to her. 'Anyone who gets christened Loelia Ponsonby ought to get used to pet names.'</p> <p>He stood beside her desk in the little anteroom which she had somehow made to seem a little more human than an office and watched her hang his coat on the iron frame of the open window.</p> <p>She was tall and dark with a reserved, unbroken beauty to which the war and five years in the Service had lent a touch of sternness. Unless she married soon, Bond thought for the hundredth time, or had a lover, her cool air of authority might easily become spinsterish and she would join the army of women who had married a career.</p> <p>Bond had told her as much, often, and he and the two other members of the 00 Section had at various times made determined assaults on her virtue. She had handled them all with the same cool motherliness (which, to salve their egos, they privately defined as frigidity) and, the day after, she treated them with small attentions and kindnesses to show that it was really her fault and that she forgave them.</p> <p>What they didn't know was that she worried herself almost to death when they were in danger and that she loved them equally; but that she had no intention of becoming emotionally involved with any man who might be dead next week. And it was true that an appointment in the Secret Service was a form of peonage. If you were a woman there wasn't much of you left for other relationships. It was easier for the men. They had an excuse for fragmentary affairs. For them marriage and children and a home were out of the question if they were to be of any use 'in the field' as it was cosily termed. But, for the women, an affair outside the Service automatically made you a 'security risk' and in the last analysis you had a choice of resignation from the Service and a normal life, or of perpetual concubinage to your King and Country.</p> <p>Loelia Ponsonby knew that she had almost reached the time for decision and all her instincts told her to get out. But every day the drama and romance of her Cavell-Nightingale world locked her more securely into the company of the other girls at Headquarters and every day it seemed more difficult to betray by resignation the father-figure which The Service had become.</p> <p>Meanwhile she was one of the most envied girls in the building, and a member of the small company of Principal Secretaries who had access to the innermost secrets of the Service - 'The Pearls and Twin-set' as they were called behind their backs by the other girls, with ironical reference to their supposedly 'Country' and 'Kensington' backgrounds - and, so far as thePersonnel Branch was concerned, her destiny in twenty years' time would be that single golden line right at the end of a New Year's Honours List, among the medals for officials of the Fishery Board, of the Post Office, of the Women's Institute, towards the bottom of the OBEs: 'Miss Loelia Ponsonby, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>She turned away from the window. She was dressed in a sugar-pink and white striped shirt and a plain dark blue skirt.</p> <p>Bond smiled into her grey eyes. 'I only call you Lil on Mondays,' he said. 'Miss Ponsonby the rest of the week. But I'll never call you Loelia. It sounds like somebody in an indecent limerick. Any messages?'</p> <p>'No,' she said shortly. She relented. 'But there's piles of stuff on your desk. Nothing urgent. But there's an awful lot of it. Oh, and the powder-vine says that 008's got out. He's in Berlin, resting. Isn't it wonderful!'</p> <p>Bond looked quickly at her. 'When did you hear that?'</p> <p>'About half an hour ago,' she said.</p> <p>Bond opened the inner door to the big office with the three desks and shut it behind him. He went and stood by the window, looking out at the late spring green of the trees in Regent's Park. So Bill had made it after all. Peenemunde and back. Resting in Berlin sounded bad. Must be in pretty poor shape. Well, he'd just have to wait for news from the only leak in the building - the girls' rest-room, known to the impotent fury of the Security staff as 'The powder-vine'.</p> <p>Bond sighed and sat down at his desk, pu...</p></p><h2>The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstitution of Social Order</h2><p>Francis Fukuyama is one of America&#39;s most astute and original thinkers, and his books have opened new perspectives on the changing world around us. In The End of History and the Last Man, he was the first to glimpse the emerging shape of the post-Cold War world. In Trust, he analyzed the social factors that create prosperity and explored how they can best be harnessed. Now, in his most provocative and far-reaching book, Fukuyama turns his attention to even more fundamental questions about the nature of modern society. The Great Disruption begins by observing that over the past thirty years, the United States and other developed countries have undergone a profound transformation from industrial to information societies; knowledge has replaced mass production as the basis of wealth, power, and social interaction. At the same time; Western societies have endured increasing levels of crime, massive changes in fertility and family structure, decreasing levels of trust, and the triumph of individualism over community. Just as the Industrial Revolution brought about momentous changes in society&#39;s moral values, a similar Great Disruption in our own time has caused profound changes in our social structure. Drawing on the latest sociological data and new theoretical models from fields as diverse as economics and biology, Fukuyama reveals that even though the old order has broken apart, a new social order is already taking shape. Part of human nature, he shows, is the fact that we are all biologically hard wired to forge bonds with one another, creating social cohesion in new and adaptive forms, not only in our neighborhoods but also in our business organizations and family structures. Indeed, he suggests, the Great Disruption of the 1960s and 1970s may be giving way to a Great Reconstruction, as Western society weaves a new fabric of social and moral values appropriate to the changed realities of the postindustrial world. The cycle of disruption and reconstruction is a familiar one in human history, and in pointing us toward the future, Francis Fukuyama challenges our assumptions about society and culture and opens up a new world of possibility. Breathtaking in its scope, The Great Disruption is an indispensable guide for how to think about the millennium about to dawn.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama cements his reputation as a wide-ranging public intellectual with this big-think book on social order and human nature. Following his earlier successes (<i>The End of History and the Last Man</i> and <i>Trust</i>), Fukuyama argues that civilization is in the midst of a revolution on a par with hunter-gatherers learning how to farm or agricultural societies turning industrial. He finds much to celebrate in this cultural, economic, and technological transformation, but "with all the blessings that flow from a more complex, information-based economy, certain bad things also happened to our social and moral life." Individualism, for example, fuels innovation and prosperity, but has also "corroded virtually all forms of authority and weakened the bonds holding families, neighborhoods, and nations together." Yet this is not a pessimistic book: "Social order, once disrupted, tends to get remade again" because humans are built for life in a civil society governed by moral rules. <p> We're on the tail end of the "great disruption," says Fukuyama, and signs suggest a coming era of much-needed social reordering. He handles complex ideas from diverse fields with ease (this is certainly the first book whose acknowledgments thank both science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson and social critic James Q. Wilson), and he writes with laser-sharp clarity. Fans of Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and David Landes's <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i> will appreciate <i>The Great Disruption</i>, as will just about any reader curious about what the new millennium may bring. This is simply one of the best nonfiction books of 1999. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p><b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is the Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University. He has served as a senior social scientist at the RAND Corporation and as deputy director of the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Staff, and is the author of <i>The End of History and the Last Man</i> and <i>Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity.</i> He lives with his wife and three children in McLean, Virginia.</p><h2>Organizational Behavior: Bridging Science and Practice Version 3.0</h2><p>By expertly weaving together the equally important strands of management theory and practice, Organizational Behavior: Bridging Science and Practice provides students with the key vocabulary, conceptual frameworks, and critical thinking skills necessary to diagnose work-based interactions, ask pertinent questions, evaluate gathered data, and act in an effective and ethical manner regardless of situational characteristics.

He argued that the spirit of the times was characterized by enervation, exhaustion, hysteria, egotism, and inability to adjust or to act. Culture had degenerated, he said, and if criminals, prostitutes, anarchists, and lunatics were degenerates, so were the authors and artists of the era. Degeneration, and the controversy it aroused, served to define the fine de si�cle. Its targets included Nietzsche, Oscar Wilde, Ibsen, Tolstoy, Richard Wagner, Zola, and Walt Whitman. The book was enormously influential. Nordau anticipated Freud in describing art as a product of neurosis, and he set a precedent for psychological and sociological critiques of literature. You may wish to talk back to <i>Degeneration</i>, as George Bernard Shaw did, but you will be entertained by its vitality. Holbrook Jackson, in <i>The Eighteen Nineties</i>, called the book "an example of the very liveliness of a period which was equally lively in making or marring itself."</p><p>Max Nordau was a famous writer, a practicing physician, a bourgeois exemplar of enterprise and energy when his Degeneration appeared in Germany in 1892.

They begin with engaging memories of his childhood and youth and of his burgeoning scientific curiosity and love of the natural world, which led to him joining the expedition on the Beagle. Darwin follows this with survey of his career and ends with a reckoning of his life's work. Interspersed with these recollections are fascinating portraits - from his devoted wife Emma and his talented father, both bullying and kind, to the leading figures of the Victorian scientific world he counted among his friends, including Lyell and Huxley. Honest and illuminating, these memoirs reveal a man who was isolated by his controversial beliefs and whose towering achievements were attained by a life-long passion for the discoveries of science.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Born in 1809 to an upper-middle-class medical family, he was destined for a career in either medicine or the Anglican Church. However, he never completed his medical education and his future changed entirely in 1831 when he joined HMS Beagle as a self-financing, independent naturalist. On returning to England in 1836 he began to write up his theories and observations which culminated in a series of books, most famously <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i> in 1859, where he challenged and contradicted contemporary biological and religious beliefs with two decades worth of scientific investigation and theory. Darwin's theory of natural selection is now the most widely accepted scientific model of how species evolve. He died in 1882 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. <br><br><b> Damien Hirst</b> is an internationally renowned English artist, who has dominated the art scene in England since the 1990s.

For some, she is the art form&#x2019;s bread and butter; for others, she is its sinfully rich dessert. Either way, the ballerina satisfies a variety of tastes for the connoisseur and occasional nibbler alike. From the sugary sweetness of her popular jewel-box image to the saltiness embodied by her carefully molded, highly eroticized flesh, the ballerina appears in the popular imagination as a painstakingly prepared dish for cultural consumption. It&#x2019;s what makes her an enigma among woman: a flesh-and-blood object of desire who as a result of an intense training, dieting and almost 400-years of strict etiquette is also a disembodied creature, more fantastical than real.<br><br>She floats on air, rising into the ether, and is variously a swan, sylph or spirit haunting our imaginations from beyond the grave. Throughout her history (and a relatively brief one considering that men dominated the art of ballet from its origins in the courts of the Renaissance until the Romantic Era, when the cult of the ballerina took flight), the ballerina has been perceived as an otherworldly creature, beyond human. Dancing in hard-tipped shoes that literally lift her above the earth, she appears to occupy a realm beyond that of the everyday. Historic lithographs of Romantic ballerinas show them with elongated necks, boneless arms and flesh as pale and translucent as the wings pinned to their backs. The ballerina comes across as a kind of feminine ideal, unblemished and ethereal, inspiration incarnate.<br><br>But the reality on the other side of the curtain is another story. The origins of the ballerina are mired in poverty and sexual exploitation. Throughout her history the ballerina has had to suffer enormous deprivation to maintain the ideal of the classical dancer as a symbol of perfection, enduring pain, frequent humiliation and even starvation to create the illusion of weightlessness on stage.<br><br>From her beginnings as a dance professional in the 16th century and continuing until today, the ballerina&#x2019;s role and identity within Western civilization has been shaped by forces that go beyond that of mere art. As much as an aesthetic symbol, the ballerina is also a social construct, a complex product of her time and place. If, as British sociologist Bryan S. Turner says, the body is the site of incorporated history, then the ballerina&#x2019;s body is the incorporated site of ballet history. In the words of pioneering American ballet dancer Agnes DeMille, Theatre always reflects the culture that produces it,&#x201d; an observation that is true also of the ballerina. Since the beginning, she has mirrored local conditions contributing to the production of art and historically specific ideas governing her role and identity within society as a professional woman of the theatre.<br><br>But what were those conditions? What social practices and attitudes turned her into a type of idealized female in the first place? How is that she appears to personify the dichotomy of spirit and flesh? What makes this wing-backed creature, an archetype in the popular imagination, so fascinatingly inscrutable?<br><br>The answers lie in the dual existence of the ballerina. Certainly there is something disturbingly schizophrenic about her identity. She appears, at first glance, a woman publicly adulated, the star of her particular show, a kind of ur-woman standing strong and statuesque on the steely tips of her pointe shoes. But behind-the-scenes, she is subtly degraded. She has devoted herself to her art from childhood, training her body away from its natural forms and curves to dance what, in essence, is an intricately patterned distortion of the body: flesh as artifice. And yet historically, she has never been duly respected or compensated for all her years of hard work and devotion to ballet. She has always been the worst paid artist in her society, subsisting dangerously close to the poverty line. That situation has hardly changed over the years: in Canada in 2001 she still ranked at the bottom of the professional artist totem pole, earning on average an annual salary of just under $10,000, a figure well below the $18,000 low-income cut-off figure for a single person living in a community of 500,000 or more, according to census data compiled by Statistics Canada.<br><br>Her lowly economic status within society has often compelled ballerinas to make choices that compromise her dignity as a human being in order to survive. It has made her vulnerable to exploitation by those of more means, in particular wealthy and socially powerful men. This is on top of the daily threat of injury imposed on her by the increased athleticism required by ballet, especially in the 21st century, and an ever diminishing age of retirement as a result of the attrition with which ballet increasingly afflicts her body. Add to this anorexia nervosa, incidents of which are higher in this sub-culture of females than in any other segment of the population. Some reports say that at least 15 per cent of all ballerinas are affected by an eating disorder as a direct result of their profession. Ballet diminishes, and in some cases maims and kills, the very dancers it elevates on pedestals of high choreographic art. When she suffers for her art&#x2014;and many ballerinas throughout history have suffered in a myriad of ways&#x2014;then the expectation is that she tolerate her pain stoically, soldier on in silence or else risk being ostracized from the hermetic sisterhood to which she has sacrificed the bulk of her youthful life. It&#x2019;s a terribly short career,&#x201d; says Bridgett Zehr, a new generation ballerina with the English National Ballet in London. You are always aware that it will be over before you are ready to say good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br>The eternal feminine has a shelf-life, in other words; it&#x2019;s just one of many ironies casting a shadow over the image of the ballerina in our society. On the surface, the ballerina appears in control, but in reality she is controlled&#x2014;by teachers, directors, choreographers (most often men), by societal expectations regarding her role as a representative of divinely patterned grace here on earth, and by ballet itself, an art with centuries of rules and regulations governing everything from body positions to etiquette built right into it. The ballerina&#x2019;s two-pronged existence, as defined by the tension between her private and public lives, is not unlike the twin White Swan/Black Swan roles danced by a single ballerina in Swan Lake, the world&#x2019;s best-loved ballet. As the Swan Queen Odette dressed in pale tights and feathery white tulle, manifestations of the ballet blanc supporting her etherealized image, the ballerina appears chaste and beyond reproach, a feminine ideal existing beyond the reach of human desire. As her wicked twin Odile, she is the ultimate seductress, manipulated by dark forces from behind the scenes which make the ballerina appear more sinister than she at first seems. It is this backstage view that fascinates&#x2014;the beastliness hidden behind the satin and sequins, and excused in the name of beauty. It&#x2019;s point of view explored by the 2010 Hollywood film, Black Swan, which showed the backstage world of ballet as a twisted hall of mirrors where ballet&#x2019;s so-called prettiness was grotesquely reflected back on itself as a life of horror. This contemporary vision of ballet&#x2019;s backroom drama contrasts sharply with the image of ballet offered up two decades earlier by A Chorus Line, an earlier pop culture phenomenon with wide-spread audience appeal which similarly used the competitive world of professional dance as a means of exploring the psychological complexities of its performers: Everything is beautiful at the ballet,&#x201d; pronounced the starry-eyed ing�nue. But is it? Even a cursory look at the art form suggests that ballet is more sweat than sweet. The ballerina herself is always more than what meets the eye. Her true essence lies somewhere in between the light and the dark.<br><br>To get a better understanding of this most enigmatic of females, a specialized sub-class of occupational worker, the following narrative presents a backstage history of the ballerina, starting with her rarefied origins in the French court of Louis XIV when the first recorded ballerinas appear on the scene, and concluding with a look at ballerinas as workers in the decidedly unglamorous world of the professional ballet company, today. <br><br>Several themes emerge: one is that the ballerina is the embodiment of a culture of manners, a leftover from ballet&#x2019;s origins as a courtly entertainment in monarchical Europe. Even today, ballerinas are expected to behave with decorum and appear as if innately elegant and graceful. Ballerinas who deviate from ballet&#x2019;s norms are ostracized, ridiculed and excluded from doing the one thing they have trained themselves for&#x2014;to dance ballet. A second theme concerns the ballerina&#x2019;s role as property; throughout her history, and lasting until the present day, she has been owned by men, the state, her art and, more recently, artistic directors and choreographers who claim it is their work, their genius, that bestow beauty upon the ballerina. A third theme revolves around the ballerina&#x2019;s relationship to the labour of ballet. The art peddles in beauty but it is a beauty manufactured much like designer label clothing produced in Third World sweatshops, in often dehumanizing conditions. Historical accounts from the 19th century describe dank, windowless, rat-infested studios condemned by public health authorities as warrens of consumptive disease. In the present day, studios might be scrubbed clean of vermin, but the lack of a consistently applied labour laws means that ballerinas are vulnerable to arbitrary discrimination and dismissal at a time when most other workplaces in the Western world are regulated by legislation based on a fundamental respect for human rights. Throughout history, there has been such a thing as a safe ballerina.<br><br>Underlying the complicated history of the ballerina is the pervasive notion of sacrifice, a theme of so many ballet classics such as Swan Lake and Gisele, but also, less obviously, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker (a seemingly benign ballet based, however, on a E.T.A Hoffmann&#x2019;s coming-of-age story about a girl who learns to relinquish her toys if she wants to grow up to dance with a Prince). Ballerinas are conditioned from a young age to accept self-sacrifice as an integral part of the art form. Ballerinas in training must learn to work through the pain, from childhood until the end of their days as dancers when mature women. They learn to numb the pain with drugs and other inhibitors; after their performances, they reach for buckets of ice in which to soak their swollen, gnarled and bleeding feet, seeking relief from the agonies of having danced in pointe shoes. Ballerinas everywhere sacrifice themselves on the burning pyre of their art, some quite literally, as shall be seen.<br><br>When they suffer for their art&#x2014;and many ballerinas throughout history have suffered in a variety of ways&#x2014;the expectation is that she tolerates her pain stoically, and in silence. If she dares speak up she risks being ostracized from the hermetic sisterhood to which she has committed her life. One ballet&#x2019;s great source of shame is how often ballerinas are mistreated and then expected to carry on, as if nothing bad has happened. It&#x2019;s a pattern of negative behaviour that appears part and parcel of the unnaturalness of ballet. Bodies aren&#x2019;t made to stand on one leg to six counts of music; bodies are rather taught how to perform such physically taxing feats without strain and without a whimper. Pain is denied, or at least its expression. An art form founded on the stiflement of discomfort has produced a culture where deprivation and degradation are allowed to flourish because it is seen to yield super-human results: to wit, standing on one leg to six counts of music.<br><br>But those performing the tricks have had to compromise themselves as individuals in support of such anti-gravitational illusions. Ballerinas, in particular, have been expected to subsume their wants and needs to keep ballet flourishing. They give their all and then in the end, when the curtain falls on their last performance, they are pushed out into the cold, soon forgotten. It&#x2019;s why the ballerina&#x2019;s life, seen from afar, looks like a balancing on the edge of a precipice, fraught with danger and the understanding that one false move and, splat, it&#x2019;s finished. It&#x2019;s a terribly short career,&#x201d; allows Bridgett Zehr, a twentysomething ballerina currently performing a principal dancer with with the English National Ballet. You are always aware that it will be over before you are ready to say good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br>Such is the gritty behind-the-scenes world of the ballet which is rooted in what one scholar has called a fairly perverse social order.[viii] The perversities are often defended as beauty, even by the victims themselves. The end justifies the means according to Suki Schorer, a former New York City Ballet dancer under George Balanchine, and later a leading teacher at the School of American Ballet. She was once asked why a student jumped without putting down her heel&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t it cause tendinitis? Yes,&#x201d; Schorer smiled, when people come into this company they get tendinitis&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>But some of that thinking has changed. Ballet shows evidence that it is becoming more in step with the 21st century in becoming more sensitive to dancers as individuals with constitutionally protected rights. Ballerinas are today having babies; they are even gaining weight as a means of protecting their bodies from repetitive injuries and prolonging their careers. Science is even ponying up to the barre to help dancers become more recognized as the elite athletes they are. There&#x2019;s more job protection and even, in places, better wages. But as the ballerina progresses so does the art form. Choreography today is more athletic and acrobatic than it was even 20 years ago. This is putting the ballerina before a new set of risks: one step forward, two steps back.</p><h2>Collier&#39;s Junior Classics: The Young Folks Shelf of Books Vol. 1 A-B-C-Go!</h2><p>Fairy Tales and fables.</p><p></p><h2>Limits to Growth</h2><p>The classic story of how exponential population growth is limited by geometric growth of resources, and the potential disasters.

Dyke and Karen Rhoads, Randy Steidl and Herb Whitlock never got a search for the truth, only cover-up and deceit from a state more concerned about image, money and politics. The morning of July 6, 1986, Dyke and Karen Rhoads were found murdered in their bedroom. Brutally stabbed over fifty times, their house was set on fire to cover up the heinous crime. With no motive and no physical evidence linking anyone to the crime, the investigation seemingly floundered. Less than one year later, two men, Randy Steidl and Herb Whitlock were arrested and convicted for the Rhoads murders. Their convictions based upon the bizarre and inconsistent stories of two unbelievable eyewitnesses, one the town drunk, the other a self-described drug addict and alcoholic, both with histories of mental illness. But the question arose, were the police and prosecutor behind manipulation and cover-up which lead to the two men being convicted? One man was put on Death Row, the other sentenced to life in prison. The two men adamantly denied their convictions and even the victims family questioned the state&#39;s version of the alleged truth. In 2000, rumblings from the Innocence Project and an impending episode on 48 Hours caused deep concerns within the Illinois State Police upper command and the corrupt administration of Governor George Ryan. Therefore, the Investigations Commander, Lieutenant Michale Callahan was assigned to review the fourteen-year-old homicide. Lieutenant Callahan&#39;s review revealed the contradictions and lies by the two unbelievable eyewitnesses, concerns of misconduct by the original investigators and prosecutor, evidence and witnesses that was withheld,and other suspects either purposefully ignored or never documented. One politically connected to Governor George Ryan.Callahan&#39;s life was changed forever when the State Police command deemed a reinvestigation of the Rhoads case, &#34;Too Politically Sensitive.&#34; For the next three years Callahan and others tried to reason with the State Police command to quit turning a blind eye to the two innocent men in prison and that the real killer or killers remained free. Each time their efforts were stonewalled by the politically compromised upper command of the Illinois State Police.Eventually Callahan turned in his upper command into the State Police&#39;s internal investigations. Callahan was betrayed by his department. The Division of Internal Investigations refused to conduct an investigation and leaked the criminal allegations back to his command who retaliated against him. Callahan fought back and filed a First Amendment civil rights law suit. In 2005, a federal jury agreed Callahan&#39;s freedom of speech was violated. One year later, the George W. Bush administration pushed the U.S. Supreme Court to take away a government employees freedom of speech while &#34;on the job.&#34; In 2008, Callahan&#39;s case was reversed when the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, &#34;Mr. Callahan was not speaking as a citizen, but as a government employee and that speech is not protected by the First Amendment.&#34; This story is a frightening example of what government, at its worst, is capable of doing, a government that also wants to silence those who would expose its wrongdoing. Both men would eventually be freed when it was determined that &#34;evidence favorable to their defense was withheld.&#34; But unfortunately, there is still no closure for Dyke and Karen Rhoads.</p><p>Michale Callahan grew up in Terre Haute, Indiana. After graduating from Indiana University with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Forensic Studies and spending a year in graduate school, he left to pursue a career in law enforcement. After graduating from the Illinois State Police Academy, he began his twenty-five year law enforcement career as a trooper in Chicago, Illinois. Four years later, he became a special agent in the State Police&#39;s Division of Criminal Investigation. In 1998, Callahan transferred downstate to East Central Illinois, where he finished out his distinguished career. During his twenty years in investigations, Callahan was promoted to sergeant, master sergeant, and lieutenant. Callahan retired from the Illinois State Police in March 2005, just weeks before his victory in federal court against his own department for violating his First Amendment rights. In 2006, he received the Edmund Burke Award from the National Lawyers Association, which was inscribed, &#34;A good man who did something to prevent the triumph of evil.&#34;</p><h2>The Power of the Other</h2><p><p>A bestselling author and expert on the psychology of leadership identifies the critical ingredient for personal and professional well-being.</p><p>Most leadership coaching focuses on helping leaders build their skills and knowledge and close performance gaps. These are necessary steps, but not sufficient. Using evidence from neuroscience and his work with leaders, Dr. Henry Cloud shows that the best performers draw on another vital resource: personal and professional relationships that fuel growth and help them surpass current limits.</p><p>Popular wisdom suggests that we should not allow others to have power over us, but the reality is that they do, for better or for worse. Consider the boss who diminishes you through cutting remarks versus one who challenges you to get better. Or the colleague who always seeks the limelight versus the one who gives you the confidence to finish a difficult project. Or the spouse who is honest and supportive versus the one who resents your success. No matter how talented, intelligent, or experienced, the greatest leaders share one commonality: the power of the others in their lives.</p><p>Combining engaging case studies, persuasive findings from cutting-edge brain research, and examples from his consulting practice, Dr. Cloud argues that whether you&#x2019;re a Navy SEAL or a corporate executive, outstanding performance depends on having the right kind of interpersonal connections to fuel personal growth and minimize toxic associations and their effects. Presenting a dynamic model of the impact these different kinds of connections produce, Dr. Cloud shows readers how to get more from themselves by drawing on the strength and expertise of others.

It can persuade us to buy something, or remind us of our first date. It can lift us out of depression when nothing else can. It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does-humans are a musical species. Oliver Sacks&#39;s compassionate, compelling tales of people struggling to adapt to different neurological conditions have fundamentally changed the way we think of our own brains, and of the human experience. In Musicophilia, he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians, and everyday people-from a man who is struck by lightning and suddenly inspired to become a pianist at the age of forty-two, to an entire group of children with Williams syndrome, who are hypermusical from birth; from people with &#34;amusia,&#34; to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans, to a man whose memory spans only seven seconds-for everything but music. Our exquisite sensitivity to music can sometimes go wrong: Sacks explores how catchy tunes can subject us to hours of mental replay, and how a surprising number of people acquire nonstop musical hallucinations that assault them night and day. Yet far more frequently, music goes right: Sacks describes how music can animate people with Parkinson&#39;s disease who cannot otherwise move, give words to stroke patients who cannot otherwise speak, and calm and organize people whose memories are ravaged by Alzheimer&#39;s or amnesia. Music is irresistible, haunting, and unforgettable, and in Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells us why.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, December 2007</b>: Legendary R&amp;B icon Ray Charles claimed that he was "born with music inside me," and neurologist Oliver Sacks believes Ray may have been right. <i>Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain</i> examines the extreme effects of music on the human brain and how lives can be utterly transformed by the simplest of harmonies. With clinical studies covering the tragic (individuals afflicted by an inability to connect with any melody) and triumphant (Alzheimer's patients who find order and comfort through music), Sacks provides an erudite look at the notion that humans are truly a "musical species." <i>--Dave Callanan</i>Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of nine previous books, including <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat </i>and<i> Awakenings </i>(which inspired the Oscar-nominated film).

There is only one thing left to do: sell her most treasured possession, her beautiful knee-length hair. But when Jim returns home he is aghast - his gift for her is the tortoiseshell combs she has coveted for so long! And to buy them he has sold his precious gold pocket-watch...for which Della has just sacrificed her hair to buy a perfect platinum chain!</p><p>Born William Sydney Porter in 1862, O. Henry lived a turbulent life including a brief spell in jail on a charge of embezzlement. Whilst there, he began writing and, once released, made a name for himself as a prolific short-story writer. He has ten collections and over 600 short stories in print. He died in 1910. P. J. Lynch is one of today&#39;s most talented and revered illustrators. He has twice won the Kate Greenaway Medal, in 1995 for The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, and in 1997 for When Jessie Came Over the Sea (9780744569636). He is also the illustrator of the bestselling A Christmas Carol and East O&#39; the Sun and West O&#39; the Moon (9781844284986). P. J. lives in Dublin.O. Henry's classic story has been embellished in this adaptation performed by the St. Charles Players. In this production, Della is rummaging through the attic on a Christmas Eve with her granddaughter. This brings back memories of a Christmas Eve many years before, and she tells the story of how she and Jim Dillingham met and courted, leading to the story we know so well. All of the performers in this work are splendid. Della, young and not so young, is vivacious and full of spunk. Jim is a confident, ambitious young man who is smitten by Della. Granddaughter cannot get enough of the story. While not faithful to the story in many respects (the setting, for example), this delightful and entertaining production is faithful to its spirit.

It was ten by twelve and stank of sweat, filth and fear. The only amenity offered was a hole in the center of the concrete floor which served as a toilet. The cell contained, so far as Rashid al-Assad had been able to gather, three Lebanese commandos who kept to themselves and were dreaded even more than their jailers. One of their number had been beaten badly during capture and was raving with fever and gangrene. This kept the others in a murderous mood. </p><p> There were also six nondescript Palestinians, none known to Rashid. From what he surmised they were nothing more than workmen, drivers or ex-army thieves, the usual Shiite dregs. They gave true Palestinian fighters a bad name, screaming under torture, wetting themselves and having nothing of importance to disclose when they quickly broke. He despised them. </p><p> The four Syrians were probably spies of one sort or another, more than likely industrial. He ignored them. </p><p> There was Rashid himself, proud to be a Shi'ite Muslim and a Hezbollah guerrilla. Not once had he uttered a sound, although they had removed everything on him that could be pulled off with a pair of pliers. </p><p> And then there was this tall blond pig of a Russian over in the corner. </p><p> This Russian was not to be known, Rashid understood. He was the only other professional there, and he was unapproachable. Someone had tried to fuck him the first night, and the Russian had killed the idiot before he could even open his mouth in protest. The corpse had been removed two days later, when the smell reached the guards two floors above. </p><p> In that very guard room Lieutenant Joram Ben Ami, watch commander of the intelligence unit at Haifa, was reading a message from his superior in Jerusalem at that very moment. The call they had both been expecting had been received from Washington at 12:45 p.m. local time, 1:45 a.m. in Washington, which was considered a good sign. It meant that the CIA was transmitting when scrambled telephone messages were least likely to attract attention. The business to which the call referred had been in process long enough to be in danger of random slipups, leaks to the press, unwanted attention from whistle-blowers and bleeding-heart congressmen, but the process had remained secret, and so the Israelis and the Americans were able to continue providing mutual benefit for each other. Ben Ami had been given the order to prepare two more units. That would make a total of ten prisoners shipped to the U.S. over the past six months, in return for which the Israeli air force would receive another five air-to-air Sparrow missiles. An excellent trade, in Ben Ami's opinion. </p><p> He chose Rashid al-Assad, the Hezbollah guerrilla, as the first. Rashid was the motherless asshole suspected of bombing a bus of Jewish settlers in downtown Haifa six weeks ago. The only unfortunate thing was that he was to be shipped untouched. </p><p> The second unit was stipulated by Ben Ami's commander -- it was to be the Russian caught spying for Iraq. He needed to be processed slightly, so Ben Ami relayed the orders to his best team. An ordinary claw hammer was used, both because it was what was on hand, and because they all hated Scud-selling Russians. His teeth came out with surprising difficulty. </p><p> Just before dawn, an unmarked American C-120 touched down on the airstrip outside the detention complex. Half a dozen long crates were fork-lifted out of the hold, and the two prisoners, heavily drugged and in handcuffs, were taken aboard by CIA operatives. The plane rose again, and the deal was done. </p><p> Twenty hours later, thousands of miles away from this airstrip and from each other, Rashid al-Assad and his Russian companion would be in the hands of an organization so secret not even the CIA spooks who acted as their handlers knew its purpose. </p><p> Neither man would survive his arrival for more than a few days. </p><p> <br> <b>St. Maurice, Switzerland</b> </p><p> Nearing orgasm, Elizabeth was having strange thoughts about being caught up in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> </p><p> She was in Dorothy's house, and the twister was sweeping around her, rattling the shutters and roaring in her ears. Wood splintered and she was lifted into the air. </p><p> Then at last she wasn't thinking at all. </p><p> All week long she had been obsessing about this afternoon, listing in one column all the reasons for showing up, in the other all the reasons for breaking the relationship off. The problem was, the same items kept popping up in both columns. </p><p> At least, for the moment, she was free of her most haunting preoccupation -- that she would never see Hans Brinkman again. </p><p> She arched her back and surrendered to the storm. She heard his cry of release, then despite his best efforts, his heart no longer seemed in it. He fell away, and a moment later he was throwing open the hotel window. He took in several deep breaths of frigid Alpine air. </p><p> She tried to catch her own breath. </p><p> He turned and smiled that perfect smile, then got back into bed with her, pulled the covers over them both and kissed her. </p><p> "That was wonderful," she said. </p><p> "But you didn't..." He made a gesture. </p><p> "No, but my watch stopped," she said lightly, returning his smile. "Really, Hans, don't worry about it." </p><p> He rolled out of bed just as quickly as he had gotten in, and gave a sigh. "I'm a selfish bastard, aren't I?" </p><p> "You are, yes, but that's <i>my</i> problem." </p><p> She tried to make it light, too, but it didn't feel that way inside. She couldn't help asking herself what all these Saturdays had amounted to, when all was said and done. Granted, he was rich and handsome, but she had been with handsome, powerful men before and hadn't felt a tenth of what she felt with Hans, or for him. The others had been devoted to her, had lavished gifts on her -- but not Hans. Attention, yes, in unpredictable bursts, but for the most part his days were spent in the world of global finance and his evenings devoted to his marriage, with all of the social life that went with it. Places she did not know and was not invited to. In fact she was, she knew, a complete secret from the rest of his life and the people in it. She did not exist in his world. Only here, in these rooms, for a few hours a month. It was not enough, even though she had allowed it to become everything she really cared about; she knew it had to end, sooner or later. And recently, she reluctantly felt it should be sooner than later. </p><p> As Hans dressed she watched him from under the covers, like a biologist studying a baffling animal from a blind. Hans Brinkman was thirty-five, ten years older than she, golden-haired, eyes flecked with green and brown. Like pools in Alpine streams, Elizabeth had thought when she first saw them -- cool, and full of hidden life. The afternoon sun glinted off his finely muscled body, his shock of thick blond hair. That last climax had been his third, yet he seemed unaffected. He was an athlete even in bed, she realized, and they were locked in some sort of contest she was probably fated to lose. </p><p> She was halfway down a hellish black diamond trail when she had first spotted him -- a flash of color shooting by on skis in the brilliant Swiss sunlight. </p><p> "On your left!" And then a blur. </p><p> This caught her attention in a hurry, since it was usually <i>her</i> passing the few who dared this sheer face. But there was something else, too. A feeling that she knew him, or needed to, and it was so strong that it was downright eerie. </p><p> Had she glimpsed a boyish grin in that streamlined, racing figure? No, just a wicked grin -- she was sure of it! </p><p> On full auto, Elizabeth shot out in a breath-stopping arc off an ice shelf she had always wisely avoided before. Half-falling, half-flying fifty yards downslope in the air, she managed to land upright only by a combination of grit, skill and pure luck. But she w</p></p><h2>Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World&#39;s Greatest Comics</h2><p>Presents a history of Marvel comics, profiling the creative artists, the writers, and the superheroes who have made Marvel the largest comic book publisher</p><p>I don't even like comic books, but I was completely enthralled by this book. The hefty 300 pages of high clay-content, color-saturated pages with over 700 illustrations and detailed text covers the 50-year history of the canonical comic books company which later became one of the industry's greatest innovators. Here there be artists highly skilled at depicting mayhem with clarity and precision, and writers who unerringly touch the (popular) collective unconscious. In addition to being highly praised within the comic book community, this book has also received rave reviews from mainstream magazines such as <i>Newsday</i> and <i>People</i>.The strongest impression one gets from this commemorative album is of the extraordinary skill with which Marvel Comics has hopped on the bandwagon throughout its 50-plus-year history. Timley Publications (Marvel's original name) started publishing superhero comics after Superman and Batman became prominent in the late 1930s (and stopped when the genre lost popularity after WW II), and romance and horror comics after competitors Prize Publications and EC Comics, respectively, popularized those genres in the late 1940s/early 1950s. When DC Comics's Justice League of America repopularized super-heroes, Marvel inaugurated its famous line of superhero comics, starting with The Fantastic Four in 1961. Daniels ( Living in Fear: The History of Horror in the Mass Media ) lays to rest the myth that Marvel publisher Lee (whose introduction is written in hyperbolic, adjective- and alliteration-laden prose) was the sole creator of those 1960s superheroes, which was Marvel's position until others in the field pushed to give proper credit to the artists who worked with Lee, especially Jack Kirby. The book does a fine job of documenting Marvel's overlooked pre-1961 background and is beautifully illustrated. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>For Lust of Knowing: Memoirs of an Intelligence Officer</h2><p>An Arabic scholar and former CIA operative offers an informed perspective of the Islamic world, recounting his career in the intelligence service and the important political figures he has met along the way</p><p>This is a charming, anecdotal report of a life spent in intelligence work in the Middle East and Africa. Grandson of one president and nephew of another, Roosevelt attended Groton and Harvard. He demonstrated a serious approach to learning "exotic" foreign languages and cultures, and a sensitive interest in the people and places he encountered. He says little about his specific activites in World War II military intelligence and post-war CIA work, but portrays the history and atmosphere of the region in lively sketches. Concluding chapters discuss his commitment to preserving American values and his views on the CIA. But the book appeals largely through colorful stories and fascinating personalities. Recommended.

More than one hundred dramatic photographs of the best of the NBA&#x2014;from legends Elgin Baylor and Bob Cousy, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, to such stars as Kobe Bryant and Grant Hill, to the greatest ever, Michael Jordan&#x2014;exemplify the power of courage, discipline, selflessness, respect, and fair play.</p><p></p></p><p>Forget for a moment the hype, the overmarketing, the exorbitant ticket prices and salaries, the bad behavior, and the greed. Instead, return to the simple basics of basketball: a court, a hoop, a ball, and a young shooter, sweating to make certain that no one is ever more prepared or confident when the game is on the line. Strip all else away, and you come to the core of the game. It's something of a sacred place for Bill Bradley, and after a decade in the NBA and three terms in the United States Senate, it's a place he revisits with real ardor and reverence in 10 gracefully illustrated essays that cohere into a marvelous reflection on essentials and values.<p> "The game is still full of joy and the lessons learned from it stay with you," he insists, "even though the game has changed, the old values still flow through it." The values he writes about may indeed seem antique beside the frenzied glitz of the NBA, but antiques like passion, discipline, selflessness, and responsibility continue to form the basis of character on and off the court. Of course, Bradley, with possible eyes on the White House, is writing about much more than basketball here. In some ways, this is a clear statement of his political philosophy: a country that can understand, instill, and pursue the values he's praising is a country that can work together. It's in these values that he finds the antidote to the tawdriness and partisanship that's managed to sully the level of the national debate. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Bill Bradley, U.S. Senator from New Jersey from 1979 to 1997 and a member of two championship New York Knicks teams, returns to the scene of his first career, and his first great passion, basketball. Things have changed since his championship days&#x2014;the shorts are longer and the salaries higher&#x2014;but what separates winners and losers remains very much the same: No collection of players, no matter how good, can win unless they form a team. And no team can succeed unless it shares common values, among them courage, discipline, resilience, respect, and an unmitigated passion for the game.<p> In ten essays, filled with intensely personal observations and reflections, Bradley revisits the basketball court with the fire of the competitor and the eye of the writer, and explores these qualities in action: the dynamics of teammates on the court and off; the pure love of the game that leads to the unselfish pass or the screen away from the ball; the individual courage to risk the last-second shot, to face a hostile crowd, to say "I blew it"; the responsibility to teammates, coaches, and fans to stay in shape, play hard, and honor the game.</p><p> <i>Values of the Game</i> is illustrated with more than one hundred twenty dramatic photographs of players, coaches, and classic games, culled from the NBA archives and the author's personal collection: from legends such as Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, and Bob Cousy,!through the brilliant Magic Johnson/Larry Bird years to young stars such as Grant Hill and Glen Rice, and of course the greatest ever, Michael Jordan.</p><p> In his best-selling <i>Life on the Run,</i> Bradley offered fans a fascinating account of the day-in day-out experiences of an NBA star. In <i>Values of the Game</i>, he shifts his thinking to a larger universe. He pulls back the curtain once again, letting us in on basketball's secrets&#x2014;many of which, it turns out, extend to life beyond the hardwood court.</p></p><h2>Sea and Sardinia (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p><b>An intriguing account of Sicilian life that reveals as much about the writer as the place, people, and customs it describes</b><br><br>Written after the First World War when he was living in Sicily, <i>Sea and Sardinia</i> records Lawrence's journey to Sardinia and back in January 1921.

Eight years after his military success, Mao Tse-tung had won out over more sophisticated rivals to become party chairman, his title for life. Isolated by his eminence, he lived like a feudal emperor for much of his reign after blood purge and agricultural failures took more lives than those killed by either Stalin or Hitler. His virtual quarantine resulted in an ideological/political divide and a devastating reign of terror that became known as the Cultural Revolution. One cannot understand today's China without first understanding Mao, and Philip Short's masterly assessment -- informed by a wealth of new sources -- allows the reader to understand this colossal figure whose shadow will dominate the twenty-first century.<br></p><p>Of the three great tyrants of the 20th century--Hitler, Stalin, and Mao--the West generally knows the least about the latter. What we do know is that he was every bit as genocidal in his policies as either of the other two great villains of the age. In fact, in purely statistical terms, Mao might have been responsible for the deaths of more people than Hitler and Stalin combined. However, Philip Short's immense but immensely readable and impressively researched biography of the man goes far deeper than this. Yes, he acknowledges, Mao was a tyrant, but then China always has been run by tyrants; it never has had a tradition of democracy. And Mao was also an idealist: the deaths of millions was, as he saw it, the price that his country had to pay for being dragged from a state of medieval servitude--perpetually on the brink of famine--to that of a modern, industrialized, self-sufficient nation, in the space of a single lifetime. Short also humanizes Mao, and shows a man who had a profound and sincere interest in Chinese philosophy and poetry, and a surprisingly sharp sense of humor. None of this can exonerate Mao from the charge of inhumanity on an epic scale. But it does make for a much more rounded and complex portrait of the figure who, as the 21st century unfolds, might be shown to have had more influence on world history than either Hitler or Stalin. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i>Philip Short has been a foreign correspondent for <i>The Times</i> (London), <i>The Economist</i>, and BBC in Uganda, Moscow, China, and Washington, D.C.

The hero's decision to leave a dull husband to pursue a career, and her rise to fame, are portrayed against the background of the cramping social order of the time.</p><p><b>Mary Austin</b> (1868 &#x2013; 1934) was an American writer.

Phillips (from the Introduction)</p></p><p><b>George MacDonald</b> (1824-1905), Scottish poet, preacher, novelist, and mystic, was one of the most original and influential writers of Victorian Britain. His books have sold in the millions of copies, and he was one of the most popular authors of the day on both sides of the Atlantic.<p></p> <p>Drawn to the pulpit early, MacDonald eventually left to pursue his writing. Numbered among Dickens, Trollope, and other giants of the age as a novelist, MacDonald ended his career with over fifty books ranging from fantastical literature, to children's stories, to critical essays, and numerous novels. In addition to writing, MacDonald lectured extensively. </p> <p>MacDonald's fiction combined the man's immense spiritual understanding with his innate storytelling ability. His works have influenced writers like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and many others. </p> <p><b>Michael Phillips</b> is an author, editor, publisher, and bookseller. He's written nearly 50 books, including many best sellers, and his current total book sales have capped five million.</p> <p>He's also the editor of 25 books by 19th-century author George MacDonald (Bethany House). Sales now top l.5 million copies. Plus, he's the founder of Sunrise Books, which issues leather-bound editions of MacDonald's original works. At age 45, Phillips is responsible for nearly 100 titles that today circulate in the Christian marketplace.</p> <p>This output stems from the printed page's greatest influence on Phillips' life. Besides the extensive library in his office, seven volumes perch in a place of honor on top of his desk. Each book represents a significant growth period in Schaeffer, C.S. Lewis, MacDonald, and Richard Foster. A key element in his work has been editing MacDonald's writings. "MacDonald has been a spiritual mentor for me," Phillips says, "exactly as he was for C.S. Lewis.</p> <p> <i>A Testament of Devotion</i> by Thomas Kelley, launched Phillips' career in bookselling. While in college preparing for what he thought would be a physics career, possibly with NASA, he read Kelley's book. "It had such a profound impact on my whole spiritual being, I began giving copies away," he says.</p> <p>While searching for inexpensive ways to purchase this book, Phillips created a small bookstore in one corner of his student apartment. This small venture grew, but after a few years in bookselling, Phillips found his interest in books leading him to write. </p> <p>Phillips has also co-written five best-selling Bethany House fiction series with fellow Eureka, CA resident Judith Pella: the HIGHLAND and two STONEWYCKE series set in Scotland, THE JOURNALS OF CORRIE BELL HOLLISTER, and THE RUSSIANS.

Narrator Morgan, a high school junior in upstate New York, feels plain and ordinary, especially next to her flirty, drop-dead-gorgeous friend Bree. When Cal, a remarkably poised and handsome senior, transfers to their school, Morgan likes him almost immediately, an attraction she hides when Bree announces that she plans to win him for herself. Cal makes no secret of his belief in Wicca, inviting most of the junior and senior classes to join him in a Wiccan celebration. The rituals powerfully affect MorganAcould it be that she, like Cal, is a "blood witch" (a descendant of one of the seven great witch clans)? But how could she be a blood witch when everyone else in her family is so clearly not "magickal"? While Tiernan's ingredients are familiar, she stirs the cauldron with engaging, even cinematic, prose and sharply individuates her characters. She introduces the Wiccan material with some depth as well as with a skillful degree of ambiguity; readers will not know immediately whether or not the series embraces Wicca. Both books end on cliffhangers (Shadows, for example, closes as Cal kisses Morgan, in full view of Bree and the rest of their newly formed coven), fanning what will surely be an already keen desire to learn the whole story.

Historian John Lewis Gaddis suggests answers to this and other vital questions about postwar diplomacy in his new book, <em>The Long Peace: Inquiries into the History of the Cold War</em>.<br> Gaddis uses recently-declassified American and British documents to explore several key issues in Cold War history that remain unresolved: Precisely what was it about the Soviet Union's behavior after World War II that American leaders found so threatening? Did the United States really want a sphere of influence in postwar Europe? What led the Truman administration first to endorse, but then immediately to back away from, a strategy designed to avoid American military involvement on the mainland of Asia? Why did the United States not use nuclear weapons during the decade in which it had an effective monopoly over them? Did American leaders really believe in the existence of an international communist "monolith"? How did Russians and Americans fall into the habit of not shooting down each other's reconnaisance satellites?<br> Relating these questions to the current status of Soviet-American relations, Gaddis makes a strong case for the relative stability of the postwar international system, a stability whose components include--and go well beyond --nuclear deterrence. The result is a provocative exercise in contemporary history, certain to generate interest, discussion, and, in the end, important new insights on both past and present aspects of the age in which we live.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em><br> <strong>John Lewis Gaddis</strong>, Distinguished Professor of History at Ohio University, is recognized as one of the leading authorities on United States foreign relations since World War II. The author of <em>The United States and Origins of the Cold War</em> and <em>Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of Postwar</em> <em>American National Security Policy</em>, he is currently writing the diplomatic history volume in the forthcoming <em>Oxford History of the United States</em> and is working as well on a biography of George F. Kennan.<br>In this collection of essays, Gaddis raises some interesting and timely questions. How is it that we have known four decades without a world war, when relations between the superpowers have been so tense? Gaddis believes that historians of the next century may look back upon our era as one of general peace and stability, despite the numerous conflicts . His explanations include nuclear deterrence and the fact that the United States and Russia studiously avoid direct confrontation, by constructing walls, using the troops of client states, or recognizing spheres of influence. This provocative and well-argued work is recommended. Jeff Northrup, Birmingham P.L.

Salkeld presents a comprehensive portrait of this impressive mountain, which draws thousands of climbers every year. The author describes Kilimanjaro as, in effect, a solitary island with unique flora and an ice-crowned, flattop appearance that has inspired folk legends and writings by Europeans ever since German missionaries initially saw it in the mid-1800s. Capably reworked by Salkeld, local oral tradition and historical accounts combine here with her personal observations of ascending through the ecological zones en route to the summit. In addition, stills of the ethereal heights and articles by experts on Kilimanjaro's geology and environmental fragility make the album irresistible on many levels. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is a hefty volume of over 30 unforgettable stories in a variety of genres-- SF, fantasy, horror, mainstream-many of them offering variations on themes and situations found in folklore and fairy tales, and including two stories, "The Cat" and "The Map," which are set in the universe of his New Sun novels. Wolfe's deconstructions/reconstructions are provocative, multilayered, and resonant. This embarrassment of literary riches is a must for all Gene Wolfe fans, and anyone who loves a good tale beautifully told.<br><br><p>At the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.</p></p><p><p><b>Gene Wolfe</b> is a winner of the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, as well as two Nebula Awards, two World Fantasy Awards, the John W.

There were masts and sails, surely. One stack, perhaps another. If the ship were really there at all. He went back to his father's beach cottage, climbed the five wooden steps, wiped his feet on the coco mat. Lissy was still in bed, but awake, sitting up now. It must have been the squeaking of the steps, he thought. Aloud he said, "Sleep good?" He crossed the room and kissed her. She caressed him and said, "You shouldn't go swimming without a suit, dear wonderful swimmer. How was the Pacific?" "Peaceful. Cold. It's too early for people to be up, and there's nobody within a mile of here anyway." "Get into bed then. How about the fish?" "Salt water makes the sheets sticky. The fish have seen them before." He went to the corner, where a showerhead poked from the wall. The beach cottage--Lissy called it a cabin--had running water of the sometimes and rusty variety. "They might bite 'em off. Sharks, you know. Little ones." "Castrating woman." The shower coughed, doused him with icy spray, coughed again. "You look worried." "No." "Is it your dad?" He shook his head, then thrust it under the spray, fingers combing his dark, curly hair. "You think he'll come out here? Today?" He withdrew, considering. "If he's back from Washington, and he knows we're here." "But he couldn't know, could he?" He turned off the shower and grabbed a towel, already damp and a trifle sandy. "I don't see how." "Only he might guess." Lissy was no longer smiling. "Where else could we go? Hey, what did we do with my underwear?" "Your place. Your folks'. Any motel." She swung long, golden legs out of bed, still holding the sheet across her lap. Her breasts were nearly perfect hemispheres, except for the tender protrusions of their pink nipples. He decided he had never seen breasts like that. He sat down on the bed beside her. "I love you very much," he said. "You know that?" It made her smile again. "Does that mean you're coming back to bed?" "If you want me to." "I want a swimming lesson. What will people say if I tell them I came here and didn't go swimming." He grinned at her. "That it's that time of the month." "You know what you are? You're filthy!" She pushed him. "Absolutely filthy! I'm going to bite your ears off." Tangled in the sheet, they fell off the bed together. "There they are!" "There what are?" "My bra and stuff. We must have kicked them under the bed. Where are our bags?" "Still in the trunk. I never carried them in." "Would you get mine? My swim suit's in it." "Sure," he said. "And put on some pants!" "My suit's in my bag too." He found his trousers and got the keys to the Triumph. Outside the sun was higher, the chill of the fall morning nearly gone. He looked for the ship and saw it. Then it winked out like a star. &nbsp; <br> That evening they made a fire of driftwood and roasted the big, greasy Italian sausages he had brought from town, making giant hot dogs by clamping them in French bread. He had brought red supermarket wine too; they chilled it in the Pacific. "I never ate this much in my life," Lissy said. "You haven't eaten anything yet." "I know, but just looking at this sandwich would make me full if I wasn't so hungry." She bit off the end. "Cuff tough woof." "What?" "Castrating woman. That's what you called me this morning, Tim. Now <i>this</i> is a castrating woman." "Don't talk with your mouth full." "You sound like my mother. Give me some wine. You're hogging it." He handed the bottle over. "It isn't bad, if you don't object to a complete lack of character." "I sleep with you, don't I?" "I have character, it's just all rotten." "You said you wanted to get married." "Let's go. You can finish that thing in the car." "You drank half the bottle. You're too high to drive." "Bullshoot." Lissy giggled. "You just said bullshoot. Now <i>that's</i> character!" He stood up. "Come on, let's go. It's only five hundred miles to Reno. We can get married there in the morning." "You're serious, aren't you?" "If you are." "Sit down." "You were testing me," he said. "That's not fair, now is it?" "You've been so worried all day. I wanted to see if it was about me--if you thought you'd made a terrible mistake." "We've made a mistake," he said. "I was trying to fix it just now." "You think your dad is going to make it rough for you--" "Us." "--for us because it might hurt him in the next election." He shook his head. "Not that. All right, maybe partly that. But he means it too. You don't understand him." "I've got a father myself." "Not like mine. Ryan was almost grown up before he left Ireland. Taught by nuns and all that. Besides, I've got six older brothers and two sisters. You're the oldest kid. Ryan's probably at least fifteen years older than your folks." "Is that really his name? Ryan Neal?" "His full name is Timothy Ryan Neal, the same as mine. I'm Timothy, Junior. He used Ryan when he went into politics because there was another Tim Neal around then, and we've always called me Tim to get away from the Junior." "I'm going to call him Tim again, like the nuns must have when he was young. Big Tim. You're Little Tim." "Okay with me. I don't know if Big Tim is going to like it." Something was moving, it seemed, out where the sun had set. Something darker against the dark horizon. "What made you Junior anyway? Usually it's the oldest boy." "He didn't want it, and would never let Mother do it. Butshe wanted to, and I was born during the Democratic convention that year." "He had to go, of course." "Yeah, he had to go, Lissy. If you don't understand that, you don't understand politics at all. They hoped I'd hold off for a few days, and what the hell, Mother'd had eight with no problems. Anyway he was used to it--he was the youngest of seven boys himself. So she got to call me what she wanted." "But then she died." The words sounded thin and lonely against the pounding of the surf. "Not because of that." Lissy upended the wine bottle; he saw her throat pulse three times. "Will I die because of that, Little Tim?" "I don't think so." He tried to think of something gracious and comforting. "If we decide we want children, that's the risk I have to take." " <i>You</i> have to take? Bullshoot." "That both of us have to take. Do you think it was easy for Ryan, raising nine kids by himself?" "You love him, don't you?" "Sure I love him. He's my father." "And now you think you might be ruining things for him. For my sake." "That's not why I want us to be married, Lissy." She was staring into the flames; he was not certain she had even heard him. "Well, now I know why his pictures look so grim. So gaunt." He stood up again. "If you're through eating ..." "You want to go back to the cabin? You can screw me right here on the beach--there's nobody here but us." "I didn't mean that." "Then why go in there and look at the walls? Out here we've got the fire and the ocean. The moon ought to be up pretty soon." "It would be warmer." "With just that dinky little kerosene stove? I'd rather sit here by the fire. In a minute I'm going to send you off to get me some more wood. You can run up to the cabin and get a shirt too if you want to." "I'm okay." "Traditional roles. Big Tim must have told you all about them. The woman has the babies and keeps the home fires burning. You're not going to end up looking like him though, are you, Little Tim?" "I suppose so. He used to look just like me." "Really?" He nodded. "He had his picture taken just after he got into politics. He was running for ward committeeman, and he had a poster made. We've still got the picture, and it looks like me with a high collar and a funny hat." "She knew, didn't she?" Lissy said. For a moment he did not understand what she meant. "Now go and get some more wood. Only don't wear yourself out, because when you come back we're going to take care of that little thing that's bothering you, and we're going to spend the night on the beach." When he came back she was asleep, but he woke her carrying her up to the beach cottage. &nbsp; <br> Next morning he woke up alone. He got up and showered and shaved, supposing that she had taken the car into town to get something for breakfast. He had filled the coffee pot and put it on before he looked out the shore-side window and saw the Triumph still waiting near the road. There was nothing to be alarmed about, of course. She had awakened before he had and gone out for an early dip. He had done the same thing himself the morning before. The little patches of green cloth that were her bathing suit were hanging over the back of a rickety chair, but then they were still damp from last night. Who would want to put on a damp, clammy suit? She had gone in naked, just as he had. He looked out the other window, wanting to see her splashing in the surf, waiting for him. The ship was there, closer now, rolling like a derelict. No smoke came from its clumsy funnel and no sails were set, but dark banners hung from its rigging. Then there was no ship, only wheeling gulls and the empty ocean. He called her name, but no one answered. He put on his trunks and a jacket and went outside. A wind had smoothed...</p><h2>Ozma of Oz (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><p>A raging sea storm carries Dorothy Gale (charming heroine of <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>) to the fairy land of Ev, where an exciting new adventure awaits her and all young readers who venture into this enchanting realm of fantasy.<br>Dorothy meets some new friends &#x2014; Billina, a friendly talking hen; Tiktok, a remarkable Copper Man; the lovely Princess Ozma of Oz; and some strange characters too &#x2014; Wheelers, with wheels for hands and feet; and Princess Langwidere who wears a different head each day.<br>When Dorothy learns that the Queen of Ev and her ten children are prisoners of the wicked Nome King, she sets out on a magic carpet with her new friends and some old favorites &#x2014; Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion, and Tin Woodman &#x2014; to rescue them.<br>The danger mounts as Princess Ozma herself falls victim to the Nome King's magic and is transformed into an emerald grasshopper.

In the tradition of the enneagram, the Virtues are said to be the affective atmosphere that replaces the compulsive and reactive emotional patterns-called the Passions-as one becomes freer of the ego.<br> <br> Sandra Maitri shows how the shift in our consciousness, or soul, from being informed by the Passions to being informed by the Virtues, is one of the hallmarks of inner development. In this book, Maitri explores how our awareness of the Passions, in turn, leads to the manifestation of the Virtues. This shift supports rowth on the level of personality as well as on the level of what is beyond-Being, or True Nature.<br> <br> Maitri is widely known as one of the most literate and indepth writers and teachers on the uses of the enneagram as a tool of inner development. In this book she provides what can be for some an entry into inner work, and for others, who have been engaged in the journey for a longer time, a uniquely incisive explication of concepts they may have missed.</p></p><p><b>Sandra Maitri</b> was a member of the first group of students to whom the Chilean psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo presented the enneagram system in the U.S. almost three decades ago. Throughout her many years of studying and teaching it, Maitri has preserved the legacy of this original transmission. In addition to her work with Naranjo, she has studied with various Eastern and Western spiritual and psychological teachers, including A.H. Almaas, founder of the contemporary spiritual path, the Diamond Approach. As one of the principal and supervising teachers of the Diamond Approach, she teaches the enneagram as part of the larger work of personal transformation, working with hundreds of students each year in the U.S. and Europe. She lives in Marin County, California."In this second book on the enneagram by Sandra Maitri, she succeeds again, and in a more effective way, in showing how the enneagram is-more than anything else-a tool for inner transformation. She achieves this in a new way, one that illuminates the basic and subtle aspects on the path of transformation."<br>-A. H.

Volume I documents the first federal elections in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. This book also covers the Constitution, the Confederation Congress, and federal elections, as well as the Confederation Congress and the First Federal Election Ordinance of September 13th, 1788.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in the three-volume set are hundreds of documents which together illuminate the critical political events of the time and the men who forged them. The documents are both official ones&#x2014;legislative journals, debates, and laws relating to the elections&#x2014;and unofficial ones, including material from letters, diaries, newspapers, broadsides, and other sources. The subjects treated include the providing for the elections by the Confederation Congress; public and private commentary prior to the elections; and summaries of official and unofficial actions for each of the thirteen original states. The editors have provided biographical sketches of the candidates for election and sketches of the political events of the time in introductions, headnotes, and editorial notes, in order to place the documents in their historical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These documents, most of which have been available to scholars only under the most difficult of circumstances, provided the basis for a more complete understanding of the fundamental political acts required to implement the Constitution after its ratification: the election of Representatives, Senators, Electors, and a President&#x2014;the men who would give shape and meaning to the government created by the Constitution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholars and students of early American history, politics, and law will refer to these volumes frequently, in order to gain a fuller comprehension of the men, the events, and the temper of the times that led to the establishment of our early federal government.</p></p><p><p>Merrill Jensen, Professor in the Department of History at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison, is the author of six books and the editor of several others concerning American history.

Didn&#x2019;t get the days I wanted, but I only have two semesters left, so it&#x2019;s getting harder to be picky about my schedule. I&#x2019;m thinking about applying to local schools for another teaching job after next semester. Hopefully, by this time next year, I&#x2019;ll be teaching again. For right now, though, I&#x2019;m living off student loans. Luckily, my grandparents have been supportive while I work on my master&#x2019;s degree. I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do it without them, that&#x2019;s for sure.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re having dinner with Gavin and Eddie tonight. I think I&#x2019;ll make cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers sound good. That&#x2019;s all I really have to say right now . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;IS LAYKEN OVER HERE OR OVER THERE?&#x201d; EDDIE ASKS, peering in the front door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Over there,&#x201d; I say from the kitchen.<br> <br>Is there a sign on my house instructing people not to knock? Lake never knocks anymore, but her comfort here apparently extends to Eddie as well. Eddie heads across the street to Lake&#x2019;s house, and Gavin walks inside, tapping his knuckles against the front door. It&#x2019;s not an official knock, but at least he&#x2019;s making an attempt.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are we eating?&#x201d; he asks. He slips his shoes off at the door and makes his way into the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Burgers.&#x201d; I hand him a spatula and point to the stove, instructing him to flip the burgers while I pull the fries out of the oven.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will, do you ever notice how we somehow always get stuck cooking?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably not a bad thing,&#x201d; I say as I loosen the fries from the pan. &#x201c;Remember Eddie&#x2019;s Alfredo?&#x201d;<br> <br>He grimaces when he remembers the Alfredo. &#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>I call Kel and Caulder into the kitchen to have them set the table. For the past year, since Lake and I have been together, Gavin and Eddie have been eating with us at least twice a week. I finally had to invest in a dining room table because the bar was getting a little too crowded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Gavin,&#x201d; Kel says. He walks into the kitchen and grabs a stack of cups out of the cabinet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Gavin responds. &#x201c;You decide where we&#x2019;re having your party next week?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kel shrugs. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe bowling. Or we could just do something here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Caulder walks into the kitchen and starts setting places at the table. I glance behind me and notice them setting an extra place. &#x201c;We expecting company?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kel invited Kiersten,&#x201d; Caulder says teasingly.<br> <br>Kiersten moved into a house on our street about a month ago, and Kel seems to have developed a slight crush on her. He won&#x2019;t admit it. He&#x2019;s just now about to turn eleven, so Lake and I expected this to happen. Kiersten&#x2019;s a few months older than he is, and a lot taller. Girls hit puberty faster than boys, so maybe he&#x2019;ll eventually catch up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next time you guys invite someone else, let me know. Now I need to make another burger.&#x201d; I walk to the refrigerator and take out one of the extra patties.<br> <br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t eat meat,&#x201d; Kel says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a vegetarian.&#x201d;<br> <br>Figures. I put the meat back in the fridge. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any fake meat. What&#x2019;s she gonna do? Eat bread?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bread&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Kiersten says as she walks through the front door&#x2014;without knocking. &#x201c;I like bread. French fries, too. I just don&#x2019;t eat things that are a result of unjustified animal homicide.&#x201d; Kiersten walks to the table and grabs the roll of paper towels and starts tearing them off, laying one beside each plate. Her self-assurance reminds me a little of Eddie&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201d; Gavin asks, watching Kiersten make herself at home. She&#x2019;s never eaten with us before, but you wouldn&#x2019;t know that by how she&#x2019;s taking command.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the eleven-year-old neighbor I was telling you about. The one I think is an imposter based on the things that come out of her mouth. I&#x2019;m beginning to suspect she&#x2019;s really a tiny adult posing as a little redheaded child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, the one Kel&#x2019;s crushing on?&#x201d; Gavin smiles, and I can see his wheels turning. He&#x2019;s already thinking of ways to embarrass Kel at dinner. Tonight should be interesting.<br> <br>Gavin and I have become pretty close this past year. It&#x2019;s good, I guess, considering how close Eddie and Lake are. Kel and Caulder really like them, too. It&#x2019;s nice. I like the setup we all have. I hope it stays this way.<br> <br>Eddie and Lake finally walk in as we&#x2019;re all sitting down at the table. Lake has her wet hair pulled up in a knot on top of her head. She&#x2019;s wearing house shoes, sweatpants, and a T-shirt. I love that about her, the fact that she&#x2019;s so comfortable here. She takes the seat next to mine and leans in and kisses me on the cheek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, babe. Sorry it took me so long. I was trying to register online for Statistics, but the class is full. Guess I&#x2019;ll have to go sweet-talk someone at the admin office tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you taking Statistics?&#x201d; Gavin asks. He grabs the ketchup and squirts it on his plate.<br> <br>&#x201c;I took Algebra Two in the winter mini-mester. I&#x2019;m trying to knock out all my math in the first year, since I hate it so much.&#x201d; Lake grabs the ketchup out of Gavin&#x2019;s hands and squirts some on my plate, then on her own.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your hurry? You&#x2019;ve already got more credits than Eddie and I do, put together,&#x201d; he says. Eddie nods in agreement as she takes a bite of her burger.<br> <br>Lake nudges her head toward Kel and Caulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already got more kids than you and Eddie put together. That&#x2019;s my hurry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your major?&#x201d; Kiersten asks Lake.<br> <br>Eddie glances toward Kiersten, finally noticing the extra person seated at the table. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kiersten looks at Eddie and smiles. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Kiersten. I live diagonal to Will and Caulder, parallel to Layken and Kel. We moved here from Detroit right before Christmas. Mom says we needed to get out of the city before the city got out of us . . . whatever that means. I&#x2019;m eleven. I&#x2019;ve been eleven since eleven-eleven-eleven. It was a pretty big day, you know. Not many people can say they turned eleven on eleven-eleven-eleven. I&#x2019;m a little bummed that I was born at three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. If I would have been born at eleven-eleven, I&#x2019;m pretty sure I could have got on the news or something. I could have recorded the segment and used it someday for my portfolio. I&#x2019;m gonna be an actress when I grow up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eddie, along with the rest of us, stares at Kiersten without responding. Kiersten is oblivious, turning to Lake to repeat her question. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your major, Layken?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lake lays her burger down on her plate and clears her throat. I know how much she hates this question. She tries to answer confidently. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t decided yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kiersten looks at her with pity. &#x201c;I see. The proverbial undecided. My oldest brother has been a sophomore in college for three years. He&#x2019;s got enough credits to have five majors by now. I think he stays undecided because he&#x2019;d rather sleep until noon every day, sit in class for three hours, and go out every night, than actually graduate and get a real job. Mom says that&#x2019;s not true&#x2014;she says it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s trying to &#x2018;discover his full potential&#x2019; by examining all of his interests. If you ask me, I think it&#x2019;s bullshit.&#x201d;<br> <br>I cough when the sip I just swallowed tries to make its way back up with my laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;You just said &#x2018;bullshit&#x2019;!&#x201d; Kel says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kel, don&#x2019;t say &#x2018;bullshit&#x2019;!&#x201d; Lake says.<br> <br>&#x201c;But she said &#x2018;bullshit&#x2019; first,&#x201d; Caulder says, defending Kel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Caulder, don&#x2019;t say &#x2018;bullshit&#x2019;!&#x201d; I yell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Kiersten says to Lake and me. &#x201c;Mom says the FCC is responsible for inventing cuss words just for media shock value. She says if everyone would just use them enough, they wouldn&#x2019;t be considered cuss words anymore, and no one would ever be offended by them.&#x201d;<br> <br>This kid is hard to keep up with!<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother encourages you to cuss?&#x201d; Gavin says.<br> <br>Kiersten nods. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see it that way. It&#x2019;s more like she&#x2019;s encouraging us to undermine a system flawed through overuse of words that are made out to be harmful, when in fact they&#x2019;re just letters, mixed together like every other word. That&#x2019;s all they are, mixed-up letters. Like, take the word &#x2018;butterfly,&#x2019; for example. What if someone decided one day that &#x2018;butterfly&#x2019; is a cuss word? People would eventually start using the word &#x2018;butterfly&#x2019; as an insult and to emphasize things in a negative way. The actual word doesn&#x2019;t mean anything. It&#x2019;s the negative association people give these words that make them cuss words. So, if we all just decided to keep saying &#x2018;butterfly&#x2019; all the time, people would stop caring. The shock value would subside, and it would become just another word again. Same with every other so-called bad word. If we would all start saying them all the time, they wouldn&#x2019;t be bad anymore. That&#x2019;s what my mom says, anyway.&#x201d; She smiles and takes a french fry and dips it in ketchup.<br> <br>I often wonder, when Kiersten&#x2019;s visiting, how she turned out the way she did. I have yet to meet her mother, but from what I&#x2019;ve gathered, she&#x2019;s definitely not ordinary. Kiersten is obviously smarter than most kids her age, even if it is in a strange way. The things that come out of her mouth make Kel and Caulder seem somewhat normal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kiersten?&#x201d; Eddie says. &#x201c;Will you be my new best friend?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lake grabs a french fry off her plate and throws it at Eddie, hitting her in the face with it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s bullshit,&#x201d; Lake says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, go butterfly yourself,&#x201d; Eddie says. She returns a fry in Lake&#x2019;s direction.<br> <br>I intercept the french fry, hoping it won&#x2019;t result in another food fight, like last week. I&#x2019;m still finding broccoli everywhere. &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I say, dropping the french fry on the table. &#x201c;If you two have another food fight in my house, I&#x2019;m kicking both of your butterflies!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lake can see I&#x2019;m serious. She squeezes my leg under the table and changes the subject. &#x201c;Suck-and-sweet time,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suck-and-sweet time?&#x201d; Kiersten asks, confused.<br> <br>Kel fills her in. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s where you have to say your suck and your sweet of the day. The good and the bad. The high and the low. We do it every night at supper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kiersten nods as though she understands.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go first,&#x201d; Eddie says. &#x201c;My suck today was registration. I got stuck in Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes. Tuesday and Thursdays were full.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone wants the Tuesday/Thursday schedules. The classes are longer, but it&#x2019;s a fair trade, having to go only twice a week rather than three times.<br> <br>&#x201c;My sweet is meeting Kiersten, my new best friend,&#x201d; Eddie says, glaring at Lake.<br> <br>Lake grabs another french fry and throws it at Eddie. Eddie ducks, and the fry goes over her head. I take Lake&#x2019;s plate and scoot it to the other side of me, out of her reach.<br> <br>Lake shrugs and smiles at me. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; She grabs a fry off my plate and puts it in her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your turn, Mr. Cooper,&#x201d; Eddie says. She still calls me that, usually when she&#x2019;s trying to point out that I&#x2019;m being a &#x201c;bore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My suck was definitely registration, too. I got Monday, Wednesday, Friday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lake turns to me, upset. &#x201c;What? I thought we were both doing Tuesday/Thursday classes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried, babe. They don&#x2019;t offer my level of courses on those days. I texted you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She pouts. &#x201c;Man, that really is a suck,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And I didn&#x2019;t get your text. I can&#x2019;t find my phone again.&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;s always losing her phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your sweet?&#x201d; Eddie asks me.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s easy. &#x201c;My sweet is right now,&#x201d; I say as I kiss Lake on the forehead.<br> <br>Kel and Caulder both groan. &#x201c;Will, that&#x2019;s your sweet every night,&#x201d; Caulder says, annoyed.<br> <br>&#x201c;My turn,&#x201d; Lake says. &#x201c;Registration was actually my sweet. I haven&#x2019;t figured out Statistics yet, but my other four classes were exactly what I wanted.&#x201d; She looks at Eddie and continues. &#x201c;My suck was losing my best friend to an eleven-year-old.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eddie laughs.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanna go,&#x201d; Kiersten says. No one objects. &#x201c;My suck was having bread for dinner,&#x201d; she says, eyeing her plate.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s ballsy. I toss another slice of bread on her plate. &#x201c;Maybe next time you show up uninvited to a carnivore&#x2019;s house, you should bring your own fake meat.&#x201d;<br> <br>She ignores my comment. &#x201c;My sweet was three o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened at three o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d; Gavin asks.<br> <br>Kiersten shrugs. &#x201c;School let out. I butterflying hate school.&#x201d;<br> <br>All three kids glance at one another, as if there&#x2019;s an unspoken agreement. I make a mental note to talk to Caulder about it later. Lake nudges me with her elbow and shoots me a questioning glance, letting me know she&#x2019;s thinking the same thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your turn, whatever your name is,&#x201d; Kiersten says to Gavin.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Gavin. And my suck would have to be the fact that an eleven-year-old has a larger vocabulary than me,&#x201d; he says, smiling at Kiersten. &#x201c;My sweet today is sort of a surprise.&#x201d; He looks at Eddie and waits for her response.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Eddie says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, what?&#x201d; Lake adds.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m curious, too. Gavin just leans back in his seat with a smile, waiting for us to guess.<br> <br>Eddie gives him a shove. &#x201c;Tell us!&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>He leans forward in his chair and slaps his hands on the table. &#x201c;I got a job! At Getty&#x2019;s, delivering pizza!&#x201d; He looks happy, for some reason.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your sweet? You&#x2019;re a pizza delivery guy?&#x201d; Eddie asks. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s more like a suck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;ve been looking for a job. And it&#x2019;s Getty&#x2019;s. We love Getty&#x2019;s!&#x201d;<br> <br>Eddie rolls her eyes. &#x201c;Well, congratulations,&#x201d; she says unconvincingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we get free pizza?&#x201d; Kel asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but we get a discount,&#x201d; Gavin replies.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my sweet, then,&#x201d; Kel says. &#x201c;Cheap pizza!&#x201d; Gavin looks pleased that someone is excited for him. &#x201c;My suck today was Principal Brill,&#x201d; Kel says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh Lord, what&#x2019;d she do?&#x201d; Lake asks him. &#x201c;Or better yet, what did you do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t just me,&#x201d; Kel says.<br> <br>Caulder puts his elbow on the table and tries to hide his face from my line of sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you do, Caulder?&#x201d; I ask him. He brings his hand down and looks up at Gavin. Gavin puts his elbow on the table and shields his face from my line of sight as well. He continues to eat as he ignores my glare. &#x201c;Gavin? What prank did you tell them about this time?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gavin grabs two fries and throws them at Kel and Caulder. &#x201c;No more! I&#x2019;m not telling you any more stories. You two get me in trouble every time!&#x201d; Kel and Caulder laugh and throw the fries back at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell on them, I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Kiersten says. &#x201c;They got in trouble at lunch. Mrs. Brill was on the other side of the cafeteria, and they were thinking of a way to get her to run. Everyone says she waddles like a duck when she runs, and we wanted to see it. So Kel pretended he was choking, and Caulder made a huge spectacle and got behind him and started beating on his back, pretending to give him the Heimlich maneuver. It freaked Mrs. Brill out! When she got to our table, Kel said he was all better. He told Mrs. Brill that Caulder saved his life. It would have been fine, but she had already told someone to call 911. Within minutes, two ambulances and a fire truck showed up at the school. One of the boys at the next table told Mrs. Brill they were faking the whole thing, so Kel got called to the office.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lake leans forward and glares at Kel. &#x201c;Please tell me this is a joke.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kel looks up with an innocent expression. &#x201c;It was a joke. I really didn&#x2019;t think anyone would call 911. Now I have to spend all next week in detention.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t Mrs. Brill call me?&#x201d; Lake asks him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure she did,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t find your phone, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ugh! If she calls me in for another conference, you&#x2019;re grounded!&#x201d;<br> <br>I look at ...</p><h2>Umbertouched (A Rosemarked Novel, 2)</h2><p>The mission was a failure.

The secret war)</h2><p>George Millar&#39;s classic World War II prisoner-of-war escape story brilliantly conveys the terrifying experience of life on the run in wartime Europe, one step ahead of the Gestapo. Captured in the Libyan desert by the German Afrika Korps and held in various prison camps in Italy, Millar was transferred to Germany after several unsuccessful escape attempts. Escaping once more, this time from his train, Millar set out to reach London and freedom. Speaking fluent French (he had been the DAILY EXPRESS Paris correspondent at the beginning of the war) he was able to pass himself off as a French labourer on his hazardous journey. But when he returned to London, decorated for his bravery, it was to discover that his wife was in love with someone else and wanted a divorce. He joined the Special Forces there and then, and began training for operations behind enemy lines in France - but that is the subject of his second book, MAQUIS, also to be published as a Cassell Military Paperback (July 2003).</p><p>George Millar won the DSO and MC during the Second World War. He fought in North Africa, was captured by the Germans but managed to escape back to England in time to join SOE. He was parachuted into France in June 1944 to coordinate resistance behind enemy lines. He wrote two volumes of wartime memoirs, Maquis and Horned Pigeon, then several sea stories (he is an accomplished yachtsman) before researching and writing The Bruneval Raid.</p><h2>Tarnished Icons</h2><p>"Rostnikov is quite simply the best cop to come out of the Soviet Union since Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko in Gorky Park."<br>--San Francisco Examiner<br><br>In the topsy-turvy world of post-communist Russia, Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov's work is never done. Three congregants from a local synagogue, gunned down in the night, are the latest victims in the seemingly systematic execution of Jews in Moscow. But the shocking identity of one of the murdered men leads Rostnikov to suspect that, rather than simple intolerance, a more calculated motive lies behind the slaughter. <br><br>Meanwhile, the city's women are under siege by The Shy One--a knife-wielding rapist who strikes without being seen. And as the last vestiges of order spin wildly out of control, a rabid antinuclear crusader plans to send a message to the New Russia via an "explosive" special delivery.

Waterpower, available to nearly every community, was used to ease many daily burdens and to imporve the living standards of the long succession of pioneer settlements. During the prerailroad years, waterpower was a crucial factor in the advance of American Industrialization, especially in water rich New England. Louis Hunter provides here a complete and detailed account of waterpower in the United States from Colonial Times to its gradual decline after 1900. The volume is an important contribution to technological, economic, and social history. The author examines closely the water mills of early settlements and small communities, explains the design and construction of various types of waterwheels, and discusses the importance of waterpower in the social structure of the time. He chronicles carefully the transition from simple waterwheels, used primarily for the production of grain and lumber to waterpower used in manufacturing, especially for the burgeoning textile industry.</p><p></p><h2>Algebra and Trigonometry 4th Ed</h2><p>Algebra and Trigonometry 4th edition by Robert Blitzer.

As he did as a featured presenter in two award-winning PBS Frontline documentaries (&#x201c;From Jesus to Christ&#x201d; and &#x201c;Apocalypse!&#x201d;), White engagingly explains the significance of some lesser-known aspects of The New Testament; in this case, the development of the stories of Jesus&#x2014;including how the gospel writers differed from one another on facts, points of view, and goals. Readers of Elaine Pagels, Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and Bart Ehrman will find much to ponder in <em>Scripting Jesus</em>.</p><p><p>In <em>Scripting Jesus</em>, famed scholar of early Christianity L. Michael White challenges us to read the gospels as they were originally intended&#x2014;as performed stories of faith rather than factual histories. White demonstrates that each of the four gospel writers had a specific audience in mind and a specific theological agenda to push, and consequently wrote and <em>rewrote</em> their lives of Jesus accordingly&#x2014;in effect, <em>scripting</em> Jesus to get a particular point across and to achieve the desired audience reaction. </p><p>The gospel stories have shaped the beliefs of almost two and a half billion Christians. But the gospel writers were not reporters&#x2014;rather, they were dramatists, and the stories they told publicly about Jesus were edited and reedited for the greatest effect. Understanding how these first-century Christians wanted to present Jesus offers us a way to make sense of the sometimes conflicting stories in the gospels. </p><p>One gospel's version of events will be at odds with another. For instance, in Jesus's birth narrative, there is no mention of a stable in Matthew or Luke, but then there are no wise men in Luke and no shepherds in Matthew. Jesus has brothers in some gospel accounts, and sisters in others, and their naming is inconsistent. Depending on which gospel you are reading, the disciples shift from bumbling morons to heroes of faith. Miracles alter or disappear altogether, and whole scenes get moved around. Such changes from one gospel to the next reveal the shaping and reshaping of the basic story in the living world of the first followers of Jesus.</p><p>With his usual engaging style, White helps us read the gospels with fresh eyes, giving us a clearer idea of what the gospel stories meant to people in ancient times, and offering insight for how we can understand Jesus's story today.</p><p>L. Michael White is Ronald Nelson Smith Chair in Classics and Christian Origins and the director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins at the University of Texas at Austin. He is the author of <em>From Jesus to Christianity</em> and has been featured in and co-written two award-winning PBS <em>Frontline</em> documentaries.</p></p><h2>England (Horrible Histories Special)</h2><p>It&#39;s history with the nasty bits left in!

Reprint.</p><p>Donna Jo Napoli thoughtfully and poetically reexamined the story of Hansel and Gretel from the witch's point of view in <i>The Magic Circle</i>. Here, she retells the Greek myth of the Sirens, whose sweet, beckoning singing caused countless shipwrecks. But did the Sirens (who Napoli imagines as mermaids) really mean for the sailors to perish? Or were these sultry singers cursed themselves? In Napoli's tale, because they are half-human, the 10 Sirens are doomed to lead short mortal lives--unless they can convince men to become their mates. But after witnessing a shipwreck in which the survivors kill one of her sisters, 17-year-old Sirena decides she would rather lose her chance at eternal life than trick a human into loving her. She vows to live alone on "an island where the first rays of sun bring sight to blind eyes.... I am going there to find new sight. I will wipe from my brain the sights I have seen and start over." Little does she know that due to a jealous goddess, a sea-serpent bite, and a dead hero, a man will come to her island and love her for herself, not just her song. Sirena is the perfect teenage heroine--questioning authority and falling in love no matter what the consequences. In creating this beautiful story, Napoli brings mythology alive for today's young adults. (Ages 12 to 15) <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Grade 8 Up-Once again Napoli takes an old story and offers new perspectives for thoughtful readers to ponder. While young people may be unfamiliar with the story of the Sirens, lack of knowledge will not prevent them from enjoying this absorbing novel. Here, the creatures are depicted as pubescent mermaids who crave the immortality that only a man's love will give them. Sirena, one of a school of 10 such sea creatures, turns her back on her sisters and chooses to live in silent isolation rather than follow her prescribed role as an enchantress. While there are plenty of references to mythic characters and events, the heart of this novel is Sirena's all-too-human story of love found and lost when the injured Philoctetes is abandoned on an island by his shipmates. As in her earlier titles, the author both expands upon the original story, offering background information and details of newly imagined events, and tells the tale from a different, decidedly personal perspective. The prose moves fluidly and the chapters flow smoothly into one another, emphasizing and complementing the watery setting and the swift passage of time. Secondary characters are clearly drawn yet retain a sense of distance that enhances the story's mythic aspects. Napoli uses Sirena's love of storytelling to insert details and information that may be unfamiliar to modern readers. This love of story will quickly and easily transfer to YAs who will fall under the spell of her siren song and eagerly await her next foray into reimagined fantasy. It is also likely that the book will encourage readers to seek out the myths and literature that inspired it.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Magic of Light: The Craft and Career of Jean Rosenthal, Pioneer in Lighting for the Modern Stage</h2><p>A lighting designer discusses the people and the productions that she has worked with, revealing the use and significance of lighting in plays, operas, musicals, and ballets</p><p></p><h2>The Female Malady: Women, Madness, and English Culture, 1890-1980</h2><p>In this informative, timely and often harrowing study, Elaine Showalter demonstrates how cultural ideas about &#39;proper&#39; feminine behaviour have shaped the definition and treatment of female insanity for 150 years, and given mental disorder in women specifically sexual connotations. Along with vivid portraits of the men who dominated psychiatry, and descriptions of the therapeutic practices that were used to bring women &#39;to their senses&#39;, she draws on diaries and narratives by inmates, and fiction from Mary Wollstonecraft to Doris Lessing, to supply a cultural perspective usually missing from studies of mental illness.</p><p>Elaine Showalter was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1941. From 1967 to 1984 she taught English and Women&#39;s Studies at Rutgers University, and she now chairs the department of English at Princeton University.Showalter, well known for her feminist studies of literature, here turns her attention to the history of psychiatry. Approaches to treatment have ranged from kindly paternalism to repressive discipline to psychosurgery to drugs. They have this in common: The treatments are devised by men and inflicted, predominantly, on women. She finds one exception, and a fascinating parallel, in the shell-shocked soldiers of World War I. Men in war, experiencing powerlessness, responded with hysterialike women. The doctors' response was to treat them like women. Showalter presents a moving, troubling history and a strong, surely controversial, argument drawing on literature and art as well as on case histories. Only feminist psychiatric theory and practice, she concludes, offer hope for change. The book is eloquently written and accessible to general and scholarly readers. Highly recommended.

Plants that withstand regional conditions and weather patterns deliver a hardier garden and require less maintenance. </p><p> A pioneering book when first published in 1999, this revised edition is a classic reference that meets the requirements of a changing, tougher landscape. Lorraine Johnson provides a fail-safe guide to beautiful low-maintenance plants native to many regions of the United States. The features include: </p> <li>Handy profiles of each native plant</li> <li>Maintenance requirements</li> <li>Creative suggestions for plant pairings</li> <li>Propagation and cultivation tips</li> <li>Index of plants by botanical name</li> <li>Ethical guidelines for gardeners</li> <li>Updated list of sources.</li> <p></p><p> Especially useful are the quick-reference charts that show plants grouped by region, habitat and conditions, for example plants that tolerate dry soil in shade and plants that attract butterflies. A color photograph of each plant makes it easy to compare options and choose the right plant. </p></p><p><p> <b>Lorraine Johnson</b> is the author of several gardening books, including <i>Grow Wild</i> and <i>Tending the Earth</i>. She also lectures widely and teaches at York University, Canada. </p><p> <b>Andrew Leyerle's</b> photographs have appeared in many books and magazines.</p><p><b>Foreword to the New Edition</b></p> <p>In the years since the first edition of this book was published, interest in native plants has grown exponentially. When I give talks and slide shows, it seems that almost everyone in the audience has at least some native plants in their gardens. Cruising the aisles at nurseries, I notice that many now have sections devoted to native plants. And every year, the number of non-profit organizations that include native plant education as part of their mandate increases.</p> <p>I think that the roots of this interest can be found in the yearning many of us feel for a better, more environmentally sane world. We might feel relatively powerless in the face of global environmental problems, but in the purview of our gardens -- the tiny bits of land we steward -- we can make a positive difference, creating small places of beauty and ecosystem health. While we no doubt need more powerful tools to effect change on a large scale (climate change and endangered species and spaces come to mind), I'm convinced that a simple trowel is a grand place to start the necessary (and, in moments of hope, I think inevitable) transformation of our culture from nature dominance to nature partnership. Dig in -- the roots of change need to be anchored deep ...</p> <p>Much of the species information in this edition remains the same as in the first edition, as does the section on propagation. The nursery listings have been changed and updated. There are a number of references in the introduction to my own backyard garden. I have not changed this text, but I have moved since I wrote this book. My new, relatively small, downtown garden (all lawn when we first moved in a couple of years ago) offers endless opportunities for experimentation -- thirty new trees and counting, a small meadow that will get shadier with each year, eventually turning (returning, really) to woodland, a shrub garden out front for the birds, a fern and sedge garden for my partner, and a profound lesson in time and transformation for me ...</p></p><h2>Revelation of Jesus Christ: Commentary on the Book of Revelation</h2><p>Intended for both scholar and layperson, this verse-by-verse commentary outlines the thematic architecture of the Apocalypse to illuminate the unified message of the book. Providing both scholarly notes and lay-oriented exposition, this landmark work recommends itself for personal study and as a college and seminary text.</p><p>"Stefanovic&#x2019;s purpose is to let the text govern the interpretation. He helps us see that the text is inspired. It is genuine prophecy. John&#x2019;s message is for everyone&#x2014;an encouraging, invigorating message for people today. Stefanovic writes an important book that takes a worldwide interpretation of Revelation and invites us to find hope and joy in the judgment." <p>J. Massynberde Ford, Professor of New Testament Studies, University of Notre Dame</p>The volume is written with the general reading audience in mind. It is intended for use in both college and seminary courses, yet it will appeal to the informed layperson. It is an expression of my strong desire to present academics, students, pastors, and laypeople with a fresh approach to Revelation so as to assist them in exploring the meaning of the book from the text through the procedure of biblical exegesis, rather than through allegorical imagination.</p><h2>Collecting and Preserving Plants</h2><p>Expert, hands-on guide to collecting for scientific, craft, and ornamental purposes.

They&#x2019;ll chat about flying teacups and cultured left feet, or point out a player who&#x2019;s jinking through the corridor of uncertainty, hoping to bag one with aplomb. Confused? Many Brits are, too.<br><br>In Football Clich�s, London-based soccer writer Adam Hurrey amusingly translates the idioms of the sport, from the quaint to the ridiculous. Here you&#x2019;ll find words for parts of the field and parts of the body; for ways to score a goal and ways to run, walk, or fake an injury. You&#x2019;ll learn to read the shifting moods of fans at a soccer match and encounter the game&#x2019;s oddly expressive gestures, which include the muted celebration and the beleaguered manager clap. Perfect for the die-hard or fair-weather fan, Football Clich�s celebrates the world of soccer in all its glory.</p><p><b>Adam Hurrey </b>is a soccer writer and has contributed articles about the unique language of soccer to the Guardian (London) and the Telegraph (UK), among others. He lives in London.<p>PENGUIN BOOKS</p> <p>FOOTBALL CLICH�S</p> <p>Adam Hurrey is a London-based football writer. He created the <i>Football Clich�s</i> blog in 2007 while working as a TV listings editor and has since contributed articles about the unique language of football to the Web sites of <i>The Guardian</i> (London) and <i>The Telegraph</i> (UK), among others. He also had trials for Swindon Town as a youngster, but was genuinely rejected for being &#x2018;too small&#x2019;.</p> <br>------------------------------<br> <p>Early Doors</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>It&#x2019;s not quite clear exactly when a cold, wet night in Stoke replaced one in Rochdale as the quintessentially English benchmark of footballing aptitude, or when sickly parrots and being beyond the orbit of the moon became so pass� as metaphors for failure and glory respectively.</p><p>Why is football so fond of a clich�? For 150 years, it&#x2019;s been somebody&#x2019;s job to relay what happens within the ninety minutes of a match and, as that coverage now reaches saturation point, a reliable formula for succinct description of the sport has become vital.</p><p>Clich� has a perhaps unhelpfully negative connotation. It implies a lack of original thought, of stifling stereotype, and the language of football can certainly be guilty of both of these. On the other hand, football clich�s are a leveller &#x2013; enabling conversation between those relative novices who believe the problem with Arsenal is that they try and walk the ball in and those who feel it&#x2019;s a little more complicated than that. Many clich�s, in any subject, qualify as such because they are overwhelmingly true. Yes, just before half-time is a good time to score a goal. When isn&#x2019;t it a good time? Well, actually, you can score too early. Words like diminutive, derisory, pulsating and profligate sit with almost absurd comfort in the footballing vernacular, while I struggle to recall anyone using the word aplomb in any other context than a well-taken goal.</p><p>Also, the heavy reliance on football&#x2019;s stock phrases (by players, fans, journalists and broadcasters alike) can often hide their inventiveness. In a century and a half, nothing has encapsulated the unpredictable swings of a football match more succinctly than a game of two halves and yet this eventually grew so hackneyed that it became a clich� to denounce it as a clich�.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, for a game whose traditional appreciation of irony extends to a player scoring against an old club, football has taken a long time to become self-aware. The proverbial good touch for a big man (despite not featuring in any ancient proverb I&#x2019;m aware of) enjoyed an unusually short shelf-life before finally becoming impossible to use without a knowing wink. Commentators increasingly prefix their accepted wisdom with &#x2018;well, it&#x2019;s the old clich�, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; and players almost apologetically declare that they &#x2018;know it&#x2019;s a clich�&#x2019; before they insist that they will be taking every game as it comes.</p><p>The football clich� has become my personal obsession. I find some infuriating, some charming and others waging a perpetual war against logic. At certain points while watching a game, I felt I could predict what was about to come out of the co-commentator&#x2019;s mouth, just as he paused to go through his mental filing cabinet to find the appropriate observation. It was this complicated relationship with the instinctive language of the sport that inspired me to start a blog called Football Clich�s eight years ago, followed by the Twitter account in 2010 and, finally, this book you&#x2019;re reading now.</p><p>It quickly emerged that football clich�s were not limited to trite words and hyberbolic metaphors. This was about gestures, mannerisms and patterns of behaviour whose origin &#x2013; sometimes fellow fans, but mostly players and managers &#x2013; was markedly clear. This book, in its unashamedly pedantic way, attempts to document every established piece of body language, every hypertruth, every grammatical oddity and every unwritten rule of football.</p><p>Not every clich� is indigenous to football but many have been commandeered, butchered and shoehorned into the lexicon because, like James Milner or a strong wall at a free kick, they do a job. Their mindless repetition in a football setting takes them further away from their original context &#x2013; heaven knows what an actual slide rule looks like &#x2013; and this alone makes them worthy of scrutiny. If the word &#x2018;clich�s&#x2019; suggests this is a sighing trawl through football&#x2019;s lazy thought and dull phraseology, well, there&#x2019;s certainly plenty of that. But there&#x2019;s ample room for celebration too. Football&#x2019;s innate drama lends itself to wonderfully colourful and evocative language, while its on-pitch stresses continue to elicit the purest, most honest displays of emotion from modern players who otherwise occupy themselves with gamesmanship, deception and self-interest.</p><p>As the autopilot coverage of football reaches its uncritical mass, it is perhaps right to embrace its idioms and idiosyncrasies and recognise them as a crucial part of the game. The next fourteen chapters will seek to uphold the football clich�s that make some sort of sense, dissect the ones that really don&#x2019;t and, ultimately, justify a childhood spent miming along to John Motson and Barry Davies on worn-out VHS goals compilations.</p><p>Adam Hurrey, June 2014</p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

There are surely more words and phrases dedicated to goalscoring attempts, successful or otherwise, than any other aspect of the game.</p><p>The curious use of the word home to describe the act of the ball going into the goal (by means of an effort, a try or a pop, to name but a few) suggests that the goal is where it belongs, and that the act of goalscoring serves to deliver the ball to its rightful place in the back of the onion bag.</p><p>Ways to Score a Goal</p><br>------------------------------<br><p></p><p>1. Fired</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>A powerful shot. Its height or range is not important, but its trajectory ought to be straight.

Arrowed</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Strictly long-range and top-corner only.</p><p></p><p></p><p>14. Thumped</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>If a thumping takes place from close-range and/or thanks to a goalkeeping howler, it may well be gleefully undertaken. As with a hammering, this act of blunt trauma can also be applied to an entire scoreline, should the margin of victory be sufficiently comprehensive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>15. Lashed</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>An instinctive act, somewhat lacking in finesse, but nevertheless useful when loitering in the penalty area.</p><p></p><p></p><p>16. Smashed</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Largely disappearing from view as a goalscoring verb, perhaps after its unfortunate reappropriation by Richard Keys.

Crashing header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Requires some collateral damage in the process, ideally an overprotected goalkeeper, as the fearless goalscorer gets a run on his markers to head home. Crashing headers overwhelmingly have a downward trajectory, which will be pointed out as a lesson for any youngsters watching at home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>19. Towering header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Equal in altitude to the crashing header, thanks to a prodigious leap comparable to that of a proverbial salmon, but not boasting the same level of physical devastation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>20. Nodded</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Usually the simplest of tasks from close range &#x2013; an aerial tap-in, if you will.</p><p></p><p></p><p>21. Glancing header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>A slow-motion replay delight, as the ball skims deftly off the goalscorer&#x2019;s head and into the far corner.</p><p></p><p></p><p>22. Bullet header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>A maximum-velocity header, often making use of the power of the cross that supplied it. Likely to be scored past a goalkeeper who, rather unhelpfully, is rooted to the spot.</p><p></p><p></p><p>23. Stooping header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Not high enough to be a towering header, nor low enough to require a...</p><p></p><p></p><p>24. Diving header</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>An art form, perfected in the 1980s by the likes of Keith Houchen and Andy Gray. May require the head to be bravely put where the boots are flying.</p><p></p><p></p><p>25. Guided</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Cemented as a goalscoring verb by its inclusion in the text commentary of Championship Manager &#x2019;93, but it remains vague. It suggests some degree of craft and composure with either the foot or the head, perhaps taking advantage of the pace of the cross that created the chance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>26.

Impudent chip</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Impudence is best displayed by diminutive forwards such as Lionel Messi, at the expense of stranded goalkeepers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>28. Audacious lob</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>The audacity of a lob is directly proportional to the distance from goal of its origin.</p><p></p><p></p><p>29. Flicked</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Varying in complexity within the six-yard box, almost at any height. A flick is often all that a teasing cross requires to succeed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>30. Backheeled</p><br>------------------------------<br><p>Frequently cheeky in general play, but possibly outrageous if trying to score from one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>31.

Despite month after month of debilitating depression, William Cowper's poetry reflected the sustaining character of God and led him to worship more deeply... David Brainerd so desired to honor God that through the loneliness of wilderness ministry and the agony of tuberculosis, he pressed on, transforming world missions forever.</p><p>When Augustine handed over the leadership of his church in A.D. 426, his successor was so overwhelmed by a sense of inadequacy that he declared, "The swan is silent," fearing the spiritual giant's voice would be lost in time. But for 1,600 years Augustine has not been silent-and neither have the men who faithfully trumpeted the cause of Christ after him. Their lives have inspired every generation of believers and should compel us to a greater passion for God.</p><p>In this noteworthy Swans Are Not Silent book, John Piper invites you into the lives of John Bunyan, William Cowper, and David Brainerd to discover how God takes the privilege of faith and strengthens it with trials so that we experience a greater hunger for him. The perseverance of these godly servants exemplifies the essential fruit that affliction can produce in your own life. Their enduring faith will fortify you in your suffering, reminding you that "behind a frowning providence, God hides a smiling face." And their stories and witness will inspire in you a similar passion for the supremacy of God in your life.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary.

His parents are glamorous jet-setters, his father a superstar, his mother a beautiful socialite, his grandfather a legend. On the surface, his life seems golden.

Eventually he will spend two years in solitary, where he manages, nonetheless, to hold fast to the brutal ethos of prison survival . . . until: he begins to reverse his savage transformation, to understand the psychological turmoil that has tormented him for years, and to prepare for what will be a profoundly challenging, but eventually deeply satisfying and successful, reentry into society at large.<br><br>Sparing no one in his sphere--least of all himself--Cameron Douglas gives us a raw and unstintingly honest recounting of his harrowing, remarkable, and, in the end, inspiring life story.</p><p>Cameron Douglas is an actor.

Burroughs was born on February 5, 1914 in St Louis. In work and in life Burroughs expressed a lifelong subversion of the morality, politics and economics of modern America. To escape those conditions, and in particular his treatment as a homosexual and a drug-user, Burroughs left his homeland in 1950, and soon after began writing. By the time of his death he was widely recognised as one of the most politically trenchant, culturally influential, and innovative artists of the twentieth century. His numerous books include Naked Lunch, Junky, Queer, Nova Express, Interzone, The Wild Boys, The Ticket That Exploded and The Soft Machine. After living in Mexico City, Tangier, Paris, and London, Burroughs finally returned to America in 1974. He died in 1997.<p>&#x201c;<i>Cities of the Red Night</i> is Burroughs's masterpiece.

At a time of deep scepticism about our ability to learn anything from the past, even to recapture any serious sense of past cultures and ways of life, Evans shows us why history is both possible and necessary. His demolition of the wilder claims of post-modern historians, who deny the possibility of any realistic grasp of history, seeks to be witty and well-balanced. He takes us into the historians&#39; workshop to show us just how good history gets written, and explains the deadly political dangers of losing a historical perspective on the way we live our lives.

At the age of 49, he shocked the outdoor world when he made a solo kayak journey down the treacherous rapids of Turnback Canyon on the remote and wild Alsek River in Canada and Alaska. <p>Blackadar's accomplishment on Turnback Canyon was the river equivalent of the first ascent of Everest, and when excerpts from his Alsek journal were published in Sports Illustrated, he became an instant sensation. He was at the top of his sport at an age when most athletes are long retired. </p><p>Then suddenly, his spectacular rise veered wildly off course when a young woman tragically died on one of his kayaking expeditions. Heartbroken over her death and plagued with mounting physical problems, his kayaking technique began to deteriorate. </p><p>Yet he had a spirit that was irrepressible, and pitting himself in a race against his body's clock, he sought out and faced off against the world's most formidable whitewater.</p></p><p>This is the true-life story of one of the outdoor world's most famous individuals. Told with consummate skill by author Ron Watters, it is a powerful and unforgettable story. It has been enthusiastically received by reviewers and readers, nationally and internationally. It's simply a good story of adventure, excitement, and the power of the human spirit. <p>Brief synopsis of the book: </p><p>On August 25, 1971, Walter Lloyd Blackadar paddled his kayak into the unknown waters of Turnback Canyon on the Alsek River. He was 49 years old and all alone in the vast, glaciated St. Elias wilderness of Canada and Alaska. </p><p>That night while trying to repair his damaged kayak, he wrote: "In the gorge and stranded. This has been a day! I want any kayaker to read my words well. The Alsek gorge is unpaddleable!" He described the rapids in the canyon as "a frothy mess that was far worse than anything I have ever seen. I am sure it was 20 degrees down with the most gigantic waves and foam and holes on all sides of me. Very narrow--like trying to run down a coiled rattler's back, the rattler striking me from all sides." </p><p>Blackadar survived his frightening run through Turnback Canyon, and in doing so, he became whitewater sport's most famous figure. His extraordinary journey down the Alsek is only one part of the story. He was a doctor. Trained at Dartmouth and Columbia, he moved west to a small town in Idaho to be near good fishing and hunting. But in time, the wilderness around him shrank in size and the once great salmon runs dwindled. Alarmed, he began to speak out for the protection of rivers and wild lands and took increasingly unpopular stands in a community whose economy was tied closely to resource extraction. </p><p>He was also a man with faults and failings. Never Turn Back is not a one-sided story. It is a carefully researched and objective look at all of Blackadar's life. Casting aside the subject-as-hero approach, Never Turn Back is a refreshing departure from most outdoor literature, telling Blackadar's story the way it happened. It is this honest portrayal that makes the book such a captivating one. From the first page through the unforgettable last chapter, it is a fascinating and candid account of a remarkable individual.</p><i>Never Turn Back</i> is the story of Walt Blackadar, the river running world's most famous personality. At the time of his death, there were dozens of other writers who could have written the book about Walt Blackadar--all of them far more widely known and more talented than I. <p>When the Blackadar family came to me, after being approached by other authors, and asked if I would take on the project, I just stood there with my mouth open and said "Me?" </p><p>Ten years later when I was still working on <i>Never Turn Back</i>, some folks had come up with their own version of the title: Never Get Finished. Fortunately, it did get finished. </p><p>The research took me to Alaska twice, including a magnificient journey down the Alsek River, the river that made Blackadar famous. On that trip, we climbed Mt. Blackadar which Canada had named in honor of Blackadar's kayaking achievements. As we neared the summit, Bob Blackadar, Walt's son, went ahead and became the first to stand on top of his father's mountain. </p><p>Reviewers and readers have been generous to me, but it was Blackadar who really wrote his own book by the life he led. I simply retold the story of his life--and what an incredible life it was.</p></p><h2>Revival Praying</h2><p>&#34;Prayer becomes &#34;faith in action&#34; in this enduring classic about how the prayers of a nation can lead to revival&#34;--Provided by publisher.</p><p><b>Leonard Ravenhill</b> was born in 1907 in the city of Leeds, in Yorkshire, England.

Though her blustery father fears for Lucy's virtue, they take the battered man in, and the insightful, beautiful Lucy is soon as drawn to the handsome, witty gentleman as he is to her. But Simon's mission, to avenge the death of his brother, pulls him in two opposing directions: his soul-deep need for revenge and his desire to protect Lucy. The exquisite romance, flawed slightly by a dearth of historical details, is touched by Hoyt's mesmerizing storytelling; in a less talented writer, the love story could easily have been overwhelmed by the revenge subplot, but Hoyt skillfully uses Lucy and Simon's internal and external conflicts&#x2014;including the threats against their lives&#x2014;to enhance her love story. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Besides the extensive library in his office, seven volumes perch in a place of honor on top of his desk. Each book represents a significant growth period in Schaeffer, C.S.

Dismayed by her parents' newfound religious beliefs, 20-year-old Amanda Rutherford seeks her own purpose in life, one that does not involve her parents or organized religion. She joins the suffragist movement and finds romance in the person of Ramsay Halifax. Realizing that her parents would not easily accept Ramsay makes him especially intriguing.

Philip Newell uses imaginative contemplation of the Gospels to bring readers to the realization that the kingdom of God is already within them. By recovering this forgotten image and learning to hear the &#34;promptings&#34; from this Paradise within, readers are led to a deeper relationship with God, a greater empathy for others and, finally, a more active involvement with the world. Imbued with Celtic spirituality&#39;s belief in the presence of God hidden in all things, this beautifully written work draws from classical Ignatian methods of contemplation. Newell shows that, at one level, we are all contemplatives. He then helps us move from prayer to social action, to share in the world&#39;s brokenness and to share our own brokenness with the world. Each chapter opens with scripture and ends with suggested exercises for Gospel contemplation. Appropriate for both private and small-group use, this is truly inspirational reading for all spiritual seekers, anyone interested in Celtic or Ignatian spirituality, anyone who meditates, anyone who prays with or is learning to pray with scripture, and anyone working for social justice. It&#39;s also ideal for small-faith communities, seasonal parish programs, and regular prayer groups.</p><p>J. Philip Newell is a Church of Scotland minister. Formerly the Warden of the famed Iona Community, he is now Warden of Spirituality for the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth, England.

From the spotted end pages on, we are up close and personal in Giraffe's and Bird's world, which is full of clouds, telephone wires, and TENSION....Sentences are short and in the present tense with verbs often in bold. The lack of background detail accentuates the actions and the warm browns and blues of the illustrations will reassure readers that this conflict might not be as bad as they think. In the end, we are reminded that actions speak louder than words."&#x2015;Booklist Starred Review</p> <p>"A charming friendship story with spare, witty text and that packs a visual punch....Vivid, textured illustrations add an extra level of hilarity to the story in a cartoon-style layout that will appeal to pre-readers looking for visual clues for comprehension.

Never before, in the course of 30 years of lecturing at the University of Vienna, had he deliberately set down, with a view to publication, the full range of his theories and observations. This series, therefore, represents a stock-taking of psychoanalysis as it stood after the secession of Adler and Jung.</p><p>Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century's greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology. His many works include The Ego and the Id; An Outline of Psycho-Analysis; Inhibitions; Symptoms and Anxiety; New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis; Civilization and Its Discontent, and others. <br> <br> Peter Gay is the author of more than twenty-five books, including the National Book Award winner The Enlightenment, the best-selling Weimar Culture, and the widely translated Freud: A Life for Our Time. He lives in New York City.In 1915 at the University of Vienna 60-year-old Sigmund Freud delivered these lectures on psychoanalysis, pointing to the interplay of unconscious and conscious forces within individual psyches. In reasoned progression he outlined core psychoanalytic concepts, such as repression, free association and libido. Sydney Walker&#39;s fast-paced delivery in a slight English accent works well. He could be Freud himself, a dynamic speaker pacing the podium, pausing with asides and checking his pocket watch to make every minute count. The listener has no sense that the text is abridged. Walker&#39;s Freud is a powerful communicator; he illuminates how Freud revolutionized our understanding of ourselves. J.H.L.

Klingaman&#x2019;s narrative history of the American home front from December 7, 1941 through the end of 1942, a psychological study of the nation under the pressure of total war.</b></p><p>For Americans on the home front, the twelve months following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor comprised the darkest year of World War Two. Despite government attempts to disguise the magnitude of American losses, it was clear that the nation had suffered a nearly unbroken string of military setbacks in the Pacific; by the autumn of 1942, government officials were openly acknowledging the possibility that the United States might lose the war.</p><p>Appeals for unity and declarations of support for the war effort in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor made it appear as though the class hostilities and partisan animosities that had beset the United States for decades &#x2015; and grown sharper during the Depression &#x2015; suddenly disappeared. They did not, and a deeply divided American society splintered further during 1942 as numerous interest groups sought to turn the wartime emergency to their own advantage.</p><p>Blunders and repeated displays of incompetence by the Roosevelt administration added to the sense of anxiety and uncertainty that hung over the nation. </p><p><i>The Darkest Year </i>focuses on Americans&#x2019; state of mind not only through what they said, but in the day-to-day details of their behavior.

With the help of some forest animals and a snow giant, Fritz and Gretl bravely make the difficult journey to the Winter King&#39;s fortress. There they learn that they must get the blessing of the Christ Child, a Christmas angel, in order for the rose to bloom and cure their father. This rediscovered German story is full of classic Christmas charm. In mini-chapters, readers share the advent of Christmas from December 6th, Saint Nikolaus Day, to December 24th, when Germans celebrate Christmas.</p><p>Else Wenz-Vietor (1882-1973) was one of the most productive and well-known illustrators in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s.

He knew the favorite dishes of King George IV, the Rothschilds and the Romanovs; he knew Napoleon's fast-food requirements, and why Empress Josephine suffered halitosis.</p><p>Car�me's recipes still grace the tables of restaurants the world over. Now classics of French cuisine, created for, and named after, the kings and queens for whom he worked, they are featured throughout this captivating biography. In the phrase first coined by Car�me, "You can try them yourself."</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Kelly</b> is an actor and writer who has created and acted in a one-man play about Car�me at New York City's 59E59 Theaters. He has lived and worked in France, Russia, South America and the United States, and writes frequently about food and travel for many British publications, including the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Guardian</i>.</p><p>He currently lives in London with his wife and son. The son of academics, Kelly was brought up in Philadelphia, Bristol and Liverpool, and is a graduate of Cambridge University, where he studied 17th and 18th century British and European history. He holds an M.A. in Theater, Film, and Television from UCLA's film school, and has appeared in the films <i>Howard's End</i>, Attenborough's <i>In Love and War</i>, Dennis Potter's <i>Cold Lazarus</i> and was nominated for Best Actor at the 2002 Montreal Film Festival for his performance as a British hostage in Chechnya in the award-winning Russian epic <i>Voina (The War)</i>. His stage work includes playing Henry V for the English Shakespeare Company; another Best Actor nomination for Tom Stoppard's <i>Arcadia</i>; and championing the lost 1800 comedy <i>A Busy Day from fringe to West End</i>. Kelly's adaptation of Justin Cartwright's Whitbread nominated novel <i>In Every Face I Meet</i> was shortlisted for the Orange Screenwriting Prize. <i>Cooking for Kings</i> is his first book.Ian was recently featured on CBS Sunday Morning, CBS TV. He has also written and presented THE REGENCY BANQUET, a syndicated program for Channel 4 in the UK, and A TASTE OF HISTORY!, a new regular feature on the <b>Richard &amp; Judy Show</b> which looks at the history of food and the food historical figures would have themselves eaten.</p>Readers who enjoy being privy to the evocative details of a past era will devour this book, and foodies will have a field day with the engrossing story of a man who literally died for gastronomy. Car�me (1783&#x2013;1833) was born poor in Paris, and by his late 20s he was already Europe's most famous chef. He cooked for monarchs and noblemen, even baking Napoleon's wedding cake, and his fame dovetailed with the rising interest in gastronomy&#x2014;what Kelly, a British actor who played a luncheon guest in <i>Howard's End</i>, calls "a cult in want of a priest." Luckily, Car�me was also a prodigious author who recorded every major meal and became rich off his cookbooks. Kelly feasts on the wealth of source material; his fine book offers a recipe at the end of each chapter, plus more in an appendix. The scale of Car�me's meals will astonish today's readers: he served literally hundreds or even thousands of elaborate dishes for throngs of guests. He'd cook for weeks on end without a break, and Kelly theorizes that he eventually died of "low-level carbon-monoxide poisoning after a lifetime of cooking over charcoal in confined spaces." Worse, this superchef was buried in an unmarked grave and no one attended his funeral (due to a cholera epidemic). But his work wasn't in vain&#x2014;we can thank Car�me for numerous culinary advances, including chef's toques, which he invented, and the course-by-course meal service we're accustomed to today. 18 color and 13 b&amp;w illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(It all began with a visit from a pair of detectives&#x2014;and a John Doe recovered from an arson scene in a trailer.) The collection is rounded out with three more stories that take Tempe from the low country of the Florida Everglades, where she makes a grisly discovery in the stomach of an eighteen-foot Burmese python, to the heights of Mount Everest, where a frozen corpse is unearthed.

In this powerful and inspiring story, Steele tells the story of his hard-won recovery from schizophrenia and how activism and advocacy helped him regain his sanity and go on to give hope and support to so many others like him.His recovery began with a small but intensely dramatic moment. One evening in the spring of 1995, shortly after starting on Risperdal, a new antipsychotic medicine, he realized that the voices that had tormented him for three decades had suddenly stopped. Terrified but also empowered by this new freedom, Steele rose to the challenge of creating a new life. Steele went on to become one of the most vocal advocates of the mentally ill, earning the respect not only of patients and families but also of professionals and policymakers all over America through his tireless devotion to a cause that transformed his life and that of countless others.The Day the Voices Stopped will endure as Ken Steele&#39;s testament for all who struggle with this heartbreaking disease.</p><p>Ken Steele was until his death from heart failure on October 7, 2000 a nationally recognized advocate for the rights of the mentally ill and the publisher of New York City Voices: A Consumer Journal for Mental Health Advocacy. He was also editor of The Reporter, the monthly newsletter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill/NYC-Metro chapter and served as spokesperson for the National Mental Health Association&#39;s &#34;Partners in Care.&#34; Claire Berman is the author of several books on family relations, including Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents and Making It as a Stepparent. She lives in New York City.From the age of 14, mental health advocate Steele battled the ruthless barrage of voices and hallucinations of schizophrenia. His arduous 32-year struggle is chronicled in this memoir, written with journalist Berman (What Am I Doing in a Step-Family?). Despite his parents' initial reluctance to admit the seriousness of his disorder, Steele, who died last year of heart failure, understood early on that his condition was pushing him ever closer to suicide. Only reading and writing provided him a haven, offering him flights of imagination that temporarily quieted the voices. Instead of seeking proper treatment, his family allowed him to drop out of school and stay idle at home, where he only got sicker. He tried to move to New York from Connecticut; to attend theater school, only to end up in a mental ward, the first of several hospitalizations. Steele then descended into alcoholism, homelessness and exploitation by male hustlers. After AA meetings, drugs, shock treatments and repeated hospitalizations, he eventually triumphed over the illness to fashion a new life. Many readers will be emotionally drained by the time he becomes a nationally recognized spokesman for the rights of the mentally ill and the publisher of New York City Voices, a publication heralding that cause. Steele's sobering yet resonant and inspiring narrative refuses to sugarcoat the tremendous force of this disorder and its stubborn resistance to recovery. (May) Forecast: Advertising in the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times should help this book find its audienceschizophrenics and their families, policy makers, mental health professionals and anyone who cares about the mentally ill.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Human Relations and Other Difficulties: Essays</h2><p><p><b>An incisive collection of essays by the editor of the <i>London Review of Books</i>, whom Hilary Mantel has called &#x201c;a presiding genius&#x201d; </b></p><p>Mary-Kay Wilmers cofounded the <i>London Review of Books</i> in 1979, and has been its sole editor since 1992.

With an appeal for history buffs as well as adventure seekers, the account describes the escapades and mishaps of amateur explorers as much as it does the reconsideration of a historical event.

While executives from within the ranks know the challenges, culture, and politics of a company, newcomers face a corporate minefield. <i>Right from the Start</i> is Ciampa and Watkins's survival manual for leaders taking starting work at a new company. "Leadership is never easy," they write. "This is never truer than when a new leader enters an organization from the outside and must change its culture in fundamental ways." Through interviews with dozens of corporate leaders who have succeeded or failed in such transitions, the authors provide a strategy for getting it right from the outset.<p> Ciampa, an independent consultant, and Watkins, a Harvard Business School associate professor, advise three key missions for new leaders: Create momentum; master the ability to learn, convey a vision, and build coalitions; and know and manage yourself well. A fast start is especially crucial. In fact, they say, the most important period starts with the recruitment or interview process and runs through the first six months in a new role. <i>Right from the Start</i> provides plenty of real-life examples of successes and failures, in everything from building coalitions to changing corporate culture. The stories tend to suffer sometimes because the executives remain anonymous.

JOSPEH KNIGHT confirms James Robertson as one of our foremost novelists. Exiled to Jamaica after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, Sir John Wedderburn made a fortune, alongside his three brothers, as a faux surgeon and sugar planter. In the 1770s, he returned to Scotland to marry and re-establish the family name. He brought with him Joseph Knight, a black slave and a token of his years in the Caribbean. Now, in 1802, Sir John Wedderburn is settling his estate, and has hired a solicitor&#39;s agent, Archibald Jamieson, to search for his former slave. The past has haunted Wedderburn ever since Culloden, and ever since he last saw Knight, in court twenty-four years ago, in a case that went to the heart of Scottish society, pitting master against slave, white against black, and rich against poor. As long as Knight is missing, Wedderburn will never be able to escape the past. Yet what will he do if Jamieson&#39;s search is successful? And what effect will this re-opening of old wounds have on those around him? Meanwhile, as Jamieson tries to unravel the true story of Joseph Knight he begins to question his own motivation. How can he possibly find a man who does not want to be found? James Robertson&#39;s second novel is a tour de force, the gripping story of a search for a life that stretches over sixty years and moves from battlefields to the plantations of Jamaica, from Enlightenment Edinburgh to the back streets of Dundee. It is a moving narrative of history, identity and ideas, that dramatically retells a fascinating but forgotten episode of Scottish history.</p><p>James Robertson is the bestselling author of THE FANATIC as well as two collections of short stories. He is a journalist, teacher of creative writing and award winning poet.`Robertson is a moralist whose deftness of touch and gift for narrative clarity disguises the sheer heft of his sermon. His belief in the power of books to alter things glows at the centre of what he writes.&#39; Ali Smith, Guardian &#39;&#39;A book of such quality as to persuade you that historical novels are the true business of the writer, that it&#39;s through the past that we might understand ourselves best, that it&#39;s in the past that the imagination can be most free, but also most authentic.&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;A brilliant achievement and a great read.&#39; Scotland on Sunday</p><h2>The Clover &amp; the Bee; A Book of Pollination</h2><p>Explains the process of pollination, describing the reproductive parts of a flower and the role that insects, birds, mammals, wind, and water play in the process</p><p>Grade 5 Up --A wealth of technical information about plant pollination is presented in the beautiful flowery style found in Robert Crowell's The Lore &amp; Legends of Flowers (1982) and Dowden's State Flowers (1987, both Crowell). There is a logic in the presentation that honors and supports the order and magnificence of nature. The color drawings are superb in the trueness of their color and in their exquisite detail. Their placement perfectly matches the text, and they are a key ingredient in the book's success. The major portion of the book is divided into three sections that present an overview of pollination. First, Dowden explains the flowers themselves, then the animals who bring about pollination, and finally she gives a description of the partnerships. A tribute to the chain of life and the delicate web of dependencies concludes the volume. Sophisticated and often technical, this book is worth the time and effort it demands to open this awe-inspiring and intricate part of the natural world to the eyes and minds of readers. --Steve Matthews, Foxcroft School, Middleburg, VA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Graphic Design: Now In Production (WALKER ART CENT)</h2><p>Graphic design has broadened its reach dramatically over the past decade, expanding from a specialized profession to a widely deployed skill. The rise of user-generated content, new methods of publishing and systems of distribution, and the wide dissemination of creative software have opened up new opportunities for design. More designers are becoming producers--authors, publishers, instigators and entrepreneurs--actively employing their creative skills as makers of content and shapers of experiences. Featuring work produced since 2000, <i>Graphic Design: Now in Production</i> explores the worlds of design-driven magazines, newspapers, books and posters; the entrepreneurial spirit of designer-produced goods; the renaissance in digital typeface design; the storytelling potential of film and television titling sequences; and the transformation of raw data into compelling information narratives. The catalogue features important original essays by leading designers that tackle themes such as the changing roles of reading and writing within the context of new technologies and self-publishing; the nature of design labor and production, from blue-collar handcraft and making to white-collar design thinking and strategy; and the impact and influence design programs and schools have had on shaping the direction of contemporary graphic design. Co-organized by Walker Art Center and Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, <i>Graphic Design: Now in Production</i> is conceived as a visual compendium in the spirit of the <i>Whole Earth Catalogue</i>. It features posters, info graphics, fonts, books, magazines, film titles, logos and more, interspersed with a variety of small texts delving into specific project details, excerpted artists' statements, interviews and published manifestos, technical details, and new and old technologies and tools.</p><p>Perhaps more than anyone else, graphic designers have influenced, and been influenced by, changes to how we receive, understand and communicate information at the turn of the millenium. In the process, the boundaries of what they do have blurred and shifted. Curated by Andrew Blauvelt, the design director and curator of Minneapolis's Walker Art Center, and Ellen Lupton, the senior curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, 'Graphic Design: Now in Production' takes stock of the profession in a time of change.

Along with these accomplishments came a profusion of splendid ceremonies, costumes and regalia ranking with the finest the world has ever seen. The greater part of these by far were directly associated with the warrior societies, civil societies and cults. It is these societies and cults that Thomas E. Mails examines closely, with skill and perception, in this handsome and fascinating book. Illustrated with meticulous pen-and-ink and charcoal drawings, and with paintings in glowing color, Dog Soldiers, Bear Men and Buffalo Women brings alive for the reader the intricate, inventive beauty of Indian costume and regalia as words alone could not do. The text and the pictures combine into a handsome and fascinating whole, a soaring evocation of the central aspect of a life-way tragically gone. For if it were still in existence in its fullness, it would enrich our lives immeasurably, whatever the color of our skins, today.</p><p></p><h2>The Hole</h2><p><p>The protagonist of <i>The Hole</i> has discovered a hole in his apartment and tries to find an explanation for it.

As the demands heat up, so do their passions&#x2014;and soon Sara can't remember just why she's fighting the devilishly seductive captain so hard. . . </p></p><p><p>At the tender age of twelve, Sabrina Jeffries decided she wanted to be a romance writer. It took her eighteen more years and a boring stint in graduate school before she sold her first book, but now her sexy and humorous historical romances routinely land on the <em>USA Today</em> and <em>New York Times</em> bestseller lists and have won several awards. She lives in North Carolina with her husband and son, where she writes full-time and is working on her next novel.</p>The Pirate Lord begins with a young crusading reformer, Miss Sara Willis, determined to experience first hand the substandard conditions and situations female convicts must face as they are transported to penal colonies in Australia. After several weeks at sea, the ill-fated ship Chastity is overtaken by the dreaded ship Satyr, vessel of the notorious Pirate Lord Gideon Horn. Gideon and his men are seeking to create their own utopia on an uncharted island and retire from the pirating business for good. All they need to make their island paradise complete is the presence of women, who will become wives to the pirate and his crew. Sara is just as stubborn as Gideon when an idea pops into her mind, and she sees that Gideon is more or less wanting to make her fellow females submit to the desires of his men, no matter that they would be legally wed. As the two leaders of the two factions butt heads on how a peaceful solution to their situation can be reached, they fall in love. Only one problem in their tropical Eden exists, Sara's stepbrother is searching for her and could possibly be the serpent that destroys the fragile paradise Gideon is seeking to build. I very much enjoyed this tale and the sparring that occurs between the two lead characters of this book. There was a wonderful dialogue and parallel love stories amid other secondary characters as well. I thought Ms. Jeffries kept all the love stories well balanced, without causing the reader undue confusion. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, if the reader sits back and just lets the marvelously developed personalities of the characters take over, the reader will not be disappointed in this book. Ms. Jeffries has a rich sense of humor, which is readily apparent in her writing and provides welcome entertainment for a few hours. Thankfully, the reader can expect more from this very talented author. Ms. Jeffries is planning a trilogy, the second of which will be the story of Jordan Willis, Sara's step-brother, in The Forbidden Lord to be released in the spring of 1999. Sabrina Jeffries spins a wondrous tale of high spirited individuals, set in fabulous locales, and creates sparkling dialogue which carries the reader away! The Pirate Lord is a rich story led by its powerfully charismatic hero and heroine who have the warmth and wit of characters Hepburn and Tracy used to play!

He understands that what has made this country the freest and most prosperous nation in history is the foundation that was laid by people who were empowered by their faith, rooted in the Word of God.&#34; --Dr. Rick Scarborough, Founder and President, Vision America Millions of Americans are alarmed over our current cultural and political climate but are afraid to speak out. They feel bullied into accepting a cultural and political outlook sharply different from what they believe. Demagogues on the Left aggressively push their ideology, making untold numbers of Americans question the historic promise and direction of their country. We need to push back against this tide of liberalism, stand up for our beliefs, and speak out in unison so our voices can be heard! In this new book, Push Back, Reclaiming the American Judeo-Christian Spirit, Rabbi Aryeh Spero challenges the Left&#39;s subversive hijacking of terms such as capitalism (page 166), compassion (page 78), tolerance (page 94), love (page 86), fairness (page 107), and social justice (page 118), among others. They distort the meaning of these words in an effort to usher in socialism and empower a liberal ruling clique to the detriment of America&#39;s middle class. In heartfelt fashion, Spero also confronts his ministry colleagues who promote what he calls religious correctness, exposing the misuse of Scripture on behalf of political correctness. Rabbi Spero urges us to stand up and proudly proclaim the values that have made America strong, free, and prosperous. He girds the reader with the strength, clarity, and fortitude to go out into the public square and fight for America&#39;s future. He boldly declares, Now is the time. Let&#39;s Roll!

Her jealous stepmother makes her do all the housework while her selfish stepsister lazes about. Since Maha&#39;s father is away fishing most of the time, there is no one to help or comfort her. All that begins to change when Maha finds a magical red fish. In return for sparing his life, the fish promises to help Maha whenever she calls him. On the night Maha is forbidden to attend a grand henna to celebrate the coming wedding of a wealthy merchant&#39;s daughter, the fish is true to his word. His magic sets in motion a chain of events that reward Maha with great happiness, and a dainty golden sandal is the key to it all. Rebecca Hickox&#39;s eloquent retelling and Will Hillenbrand&#39;s lush pictures offer a beguiling version of a story well-loved by many cultures the world over.</p><p>What do you get when you take Cinderella's glass slipper and transport it to the Middle East? <i>The Golden Sandal</i>! Rebecca Hickox's delightful retelling of an Iraqi folktale "The Little Red Fish and the Clog of Gold" has all the makings of any good Cinderella story--the mean stepmother, the young oppressed girl, a big shindig, a kind, magical creature who helps the girl dress up for the event, an enamored young man, a lost-and-found shoe, and the promise of a happy ending. However, with the Arabian twist, the girl's name is Maha, the benevolent creature is a fish, the shindig is a "grand henna," and the shoe that ultimately saves Maha from a cruel fate is none other than a golden sandal.<p> Rebecca Hickox, author of <i>Zorro and Quwi</i>, <i>Per and the Dala Horse</i> and <i>Matreshka</i>, teams up with the well-loved illustrator Will Hillenbrand of <i>The Tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</i>, <i>Counting Crocodiles</i>, and the award-winning <i>Wicked Jack</i> to create this fresh twist on a familiar tale--guaranteed to keep youngsters riveted until the satisfying ending when justice prevails! <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>Rebecca Hickox is the author of Zorro and Quwi; Tales of a Trickster Guinea Pig, illustrated by Kim Howard, which Kirkus Reviews calls "delightful," in a pointer review, Per and the Dala Horse, illustrated by Yvonne Gilbert, an American Bookseller Pick of the Lists selection, and Matreshka, illustrated by Alexi Natchev, which Booklist praises as "cleverly told."

The half-destroyed cities have become uninhabitable through radiation. Beyond their boundaries, they say, lie endless burned-out deserts and the remains of splintered forests. Survivors still remember the past greatness of humankind. But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. <br>More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires. Man has handed over stewardship of the earth to new life-forms. Mutated by radiation, they are better adapted to the new world. Man's time is over.<br>A few score thousand survivors live on, not knowing whether they are the only ones left on earth. They live in the Moscow Metro - the biggest air-raid shelter ever built. It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. <br>VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared. Artyom, a young man living in VDNKh, is given the task of penetrating to the heart of the Metro, to the legendary Polis, to alert everyone to the awful danger and to get help. He holds the future of his native station in his hands, the whole Metro - and maybe the whole of humanity.</p></p><p>After the nuclear holocaust a new fear is born - underground . . .Dmitry Glukhovsky is a Journalism and Foreign Relations graduate of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

He is a clear, fluent writer; evocative, acute, sympathetic, but absolutely unblinking about the notorious weaknesses and cruelties (as well as the immense wit and hard work) of his subject.&#34;--Richard Locke, The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Royal Hollway, University of LondonOne of three literary executors of British poet Philip Larkin (1922-85), fellow poet Motion (The Lamberts, 1987) ill serves his subject with this drab, exhaustive biography full of bland literary criticism and inappropriate psychologizing. With complete access to Larkin's unpublished archival material--from which he quotes liberally--Motion establishes that Larkin's father was a Nazi sympathizer, as well as a misogynist and an autocratic parent, and that the poet's ``whining'' mother exerted an equally debilitating influence on her sensitive son. Tall and gawky, young Philip stammered and made few friends: This overwhelming sense of isolation stayed with him even through his years of critical acclaim. A voracious reader, he idolized Auden, Lawrence, and Yeats, despite his later antimodernist stance. At Oxford, Larkin formed his legendary friendship with Kingsley Amis, whose fame he would continually envy even as they shared a love of jazz and drinking, as well as a hatred of pretension. Larkin experienced difficulty with girls, not losing his virginity until well into his first job as a librarian (``handing out tripey novels to morons''). While developing his career--he created a major library at Hull--he also gained stature as a writer. Hoping to equal the achievements of Amis and their friend, Bruce Montgomery, he devoted his early efforts to fiction, producing two novels, Jill and A Girl in Winter, which was a modest success. But Larkin's real greatness was as a poet. Some juvenilia inspired largely by Yeats was eclipsed by his mature work--poetry in the plain-speaking tradition of Hardy, Housman, and Edward Thomas. The obsessions of his verse--sadness, death, failure--flow directly from his troubled life (fearing marriage and family, he managed to maintain three long relationships with dramatically different types of women), though he himself always discouraged such readings. Sure to be the standard life for some time, this cadaverous book seems dead to Larkin's amazing sense of humor, one of the sources of his poetic achievement.

Fifteen years later, two men were dramatically expelled from the Quorum of Twelve Apostles for having taken post-Manifesto plural wives and encouraged the step by others. Evidence reveals, however, that hundreds of Mormons (including several apostles) were given approval to enter such relationships after they supposedly were banned.<br>Why would Mormon leaders endanger agreements allowing Utah to become a state and risk their church's reputation by engaging in such activities--all the while denying the fact to the world? This book seeks to find the answer through a review of the Mormon polygamous experience from its beginnings.<br>In the course of national debate over polygamy, Americans generally were unbending in their allegiance to monogamy. Solemn Covenant provides the most careful examination ever undertaken of Mormon theological, social, and biological defenses of "the principle."<br>Although polygamy was never a way of life for the majority of Latter-day Saints in the nineteenth century, Carmon Hardy contends that plural marriage enjoyed a more important place in the Saints' restorationist vision than most historians have allowed. Many Mormons considered polygamy a prescription for health, an antidote for immorality, and a key to better government. Despite intense pressure from the nation to end the experiment, because of their belief in its importance and gifts, polygamy endured as an approved arrangement among church members well into the twentieth century.<br>Hardy demonstrates how Woodruff's Manifesto of 1890 evolved from a tactic to preserve polygamy into a revelation now used to prohibit it. Solemn Covenant examines the halting passage followed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as it transformed itself into one of America's most vigilant champions of the monogamous way.</p><p>&#34;Adroitly delivered ... gripping in topic ... heartrending in description of the human experience... compelling in its social arguments.&#34; -- American Historical Review</p><h2>Long Lavender Look</h2><p>"McGee has become part of our national fabric."<br><br>SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER<br><br>A lovely young girl steps in front of Travis McGee's headlights.

Lomax--of the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, Alan Lomax traveled the South &#34;from the Brazos bottoms of Texas to the tidewater country of Virginia&#34; in search of the wellspring of American blues. Previously the author of Mister Jelly Roll, Lomax stalks the ghosts of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Big Bill Broonzy and Charlie Patton, among many other blues pioneers. This winner of the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction is more than just another profile of a musical genre. It&#39;s an intimate diary of a purely American art form born of a powerful mix of despair and hope.Set in an era as harsh and fertile as Delta silt, <i>The Land Where The Blues Began</i> reveals how the river of African American culture overtook its repressive banks--to give us R &amp; B, soul, rock 'n' roll, and the only purely American art form, the blues. Alan Lomax takes us on an adventure into the "bad old days" of the post-slavery, Kim Crow Mississippi Delta--the birthplace of the blues--when railroads and levees were being built and cotton boomed at the expense of Southern working-class African Americans. Singing of their misery and their barely concealed rage, the Bluesman enlisted their African heritage to keep their souls alive and in the process created the first satirical song form in the English language. We meet Muddy Waters (the father of modern blues), learn how Robert Johnson met his end, and are introduced to Fred McDowell and Son House, who taught Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton how to play the blues.<p></p><p>"If not for Lomax, few people would have heard 'Tom Dooley' or 'Goodnight Irene, and Bob Zimmerman might be singing 'Feelings' at Holiday Inns around Hibbing, Minnesota."--<i>Newsweek</i></p></p><h2>Thoughts for Young Men</h2><p>I Heartily Endorse It!&#34; .... and strongly commend it to both Christian leaders and fathers, not to mention older and younger men alike.&#34;-John MacArthur, Jr. &#34;Ryle Is Magnificent!

Today, napalm lives on as a pariah: a symbol of American cruelty and the misguided use of power, according to anti-war protesters in the 1960s and popular culture from <i>Apocalypse Now</i> to the punk band Napalm Death and British street artist Banksy. Its use by Serbia in 1994 and by the United States in Iraq in 2003 drew condemnation. United Nations delegates judged deployment against concentrations of civilians a war crime in 1980.

Jardine's attention to the material side of things is an important explanatory complement to the many histories of the period that have dwelt on the sublime works of art . . . Real history is in the details, the small stories, of which WORLDLY GOODS is a treasure house."<br>Richard Bernstein, The New York Times</p><p>Drawing from her earlier and more academic studies, Lisa Jardine approaches the challenge of creating a new history of the Renaissance with remarkable bravura and all the boldness required to deliver a fresh and highly readable story of an age we think we know so well. In <b>Worldly Goods</b>, Jardine argues that while the Renaissance was indeed marked by a flourishing cultural identity, it was the material and commercial spirit of the 15th and 16th centuries that set the tone. Commerce and international trade provided the enormous fortunes that funded artistic production, and luxury goods, including great works of art, became important as means of displaying newly acquired wealth and status. It was an urge to own, a ceaseless quest for new horizons and exotic treasures, that fueled the cultural output of the Renaissance, according to Jardine, and that taste for conspicuous displays of opulence characterizes the Western experience of the arts and culture to this day. <p>That <b>Worldly Goods</b> succeeds in telling a captivating new story of the Renaissance is testimony to Jardine's literary and scholarly success at a difficult task. That her book, richly illustrated and well written, makes contemplation of its subject a thrill is testimony of a very good read.</p>LISA JARDINE is author of INGENIOUS PURSUITS.

The Bible for Children contains more than 200 Bible stories, retold by playwright and filmmaker Murray Watts and elegantly illustrated by beloved artist, Helen Cann. The stories comprehensively cover key themes of the Bible; they are faithful to the meaning and spirit of the original Scripture. The imaginative style reflects the variety of the biblical text riveting stories, reporting, poetry, history, letters. The Bible for Children is a visual delight, filled with illustrations that add meaning to the stories. The rich color, the exquisitely drawn faces and settings draw readers into the emotion and power of all that happens. This book for 7-12 year-olds has the design and drama of a modern classic. Author Murray Watts has written many books and plays. He has also directed and produced for the theater and for film, radio, and television. Helen Cann is an experienced illustrator of books for children, including several that deal with ancient stories. Her art has been widely exhibited and can be found in private collections in the United States and Europe.</p><p>Murray Watts' childhood love of literature and the Bible has been an enduring influence on his life.

This is the last page to be written and, for me, the hardest of all. How can I describe the joys, fears, challenges and surprises of such an exhilarating journey? I can only hope that some of this experience will shine through my retelling of these great stories. Writing this book has been an adventure for me, and I hope it will be the same for anyone who reads it.<br>I have frequently been moved by the struggles and failures of the characters in these stories, as well as by the many heartwarming examples of courage and nobility. The men, women and children of the Bible are so like us, and the themes of the Bible do not become dated. This is a love story: the moving tale of God's love for the world in all its wonder and all its brokenness. It is full of beauty and hope, but it is also very realistic about people and the consequences of their actions.<br>The Bible is not simply one book but a library of great works, written over hundreds of years, recording the experiences of many different personalities and their times. In The Bible for Children, I have tried to reflect the magnificent breadth of this material, expressed in a rich variety of history, story and song. In my view, there is no need to limit younger readers to a cautiously edited and sentimental version. They will bring their own insights, questions and responses to these narratives.<br>This retelling also shows how people's knowledge of God deepened and developed over centuries - there is a vast difference between the harsh and sometimes warlike world of some books of the Old Testament and the love and forgiveness we see in the life of Jesus, many generations later. However, there is a strong sense of continuity throughout the Bible and a profound unity, which has influenced my retelling. <br>I was very fortunate in having parents who valued the Bible, taught me to love its stories and also encouraged me to learn from them. I hope that a new generation of children will be given the same privilege through parents, friends or family members who will share with them this treasure-trove of adventure, high drama, tragedy, joy and love.<br>Murray Watts<br><b>The Creation<br></b>Genesis 1, 2<br>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. <br>The earth was formless and empty, darkness lay over the deep oceans, and God's Spirit was moving over the surface of the waters.<br>Then God spoke: "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good. He divided the light from the darkness. And so God named the light Day and the darkness Night. There was evening and morning, the very first day.<br><p>And God said, "Let there be a space above the oceans, to separate the heavens from the earth." And it was so, and God named this space Sky. There was evening and morning again, and that was the second day.<br>And God said, "Let dry ground appear from the deep waters." And it was so. God named the dry ground Land and the waters he named Seas. God looked at what he had made and saw that it was good.<br>Then God said, "Let the land produce plants and crops and fruit trees of every kind." And it was so. There was evening and morning, and that was the third day.<br>And God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to divide the day from the night, marking the days, the seasons and the turning of the years, and let the lights shine down on the earth." And it was so. God made the sun to shine in the day and the moon to shine at night. Then God made the stars. And God saw that all that he had made was good. So evening and morning came again, and that was the fourth day.<br>God said, "Let the waters breed life and swarm with living creatures, and let birds wing their way through the sky." So God created the huge sea-creatures and every living being that glides through the waters and all species of fish, and he made every kind of bird that flies through the air. And God saw that all that he had made was good. He blessed the creatures and said, "Be fruitful and multiply, fill the seas, fill the air!" So evening and morning came again, and that was the fifth day.<br>And God said, "Let the earth produce every type of animal, all species of living creatures, cattle and reptiles and wild beasts of every kind." And it was so. And God saw that it was good.<br>Then God said, "I shall make human beings in my image, in my own likeness. Let them rule the animal kingdom and be responsible for the whole earth."<br>So God created human beings. He made them in his own image, creating both male and female.<br>God blessed the human race and said, "Fill the earth with your descendants and look after everything I have created."<br>And God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. So evening and morning came again, and that was the sixth day.<br>In this way, the heavens and the earth were completed in all their magnificence.<br>By the seventh day, God had finished all his work of creation, so he rested on that day. He blessed the seventh day, because it was the special day of his rest.<br><b>Shepherds and Angels<br></b>Luke 2<br>That night, there were shepherds out in the fields around Bethlehem, guarding their sheep. They were sitting beside their fire, keeping warm and watching the flames crackle and spit into the darkness. There was no danger - no wild beasts prowling or thieves breaking into the sheepfold; there was only the roar of the fire and the smoke curling up to the stars. <br>They were chatting softly, making jokes, telling stories, when suddenly a great light flashed from the sky. The shepherds leaped up, terrified. They wanted to run, but there was light all around them -- above them, behind them. The whole sky was burning, and the earth was on fire with glory and wonder. An angel towered over them, and they fell to the ground in fear. "Don't be afraid! I've come bringing good news for you and for everyone in the world."<br>The shepherds looked up slowly, peering through their fingers as the angel continued: "Today in the town of David, a saviour has been born for you. He is Christ the Lord, and here is the sign that this is true: you will find a little baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger!"<br>At that moment, the bright figure was joined by a great company of angels from heaven, thousands of them filling the sky and singing: "Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to all those he loves!"<br>Earth and heaven shook with sound, thundering music echoed in the hills and rang from every stone until at last the glory faded, and the singing drifted away like smoke into the night air.<br>The shepherds were alone. They scrambled up nervously. "We'd better go to Bethlehem and see all this for ourselves," they said.<br>And so they ran to Bethlehem and went from house to house, inn to inn, until they found the stable.<br>Inside, they gathered around, their scruffy faces staring from the darkness into the lamplight that shone over the little family: Mary sitting calmly, almost as if she expected them; Joseph standing up, wondering who it was at this time of night; and the baby lying in the hay and gazing at them so clearly.<br>The shepherds told Mary and Joseph everything they had seen and heard, and Mary kept the wonderful words of the angel in her heart, like treasures, stored up forever.<br></p></p><h2>Queen Mary 1867-1953</h2><p>As official biographer, the author had access to private papers which helped unfold the moving story of Princess May of Teck's impoverished childhood, her significant reign and her old age as the much admired Queen Dowager; she saw her fiancee, husband and three sons die, and another abdicate before her own death in 1953.<br></p><p>James Pope-Hennessy was a writer of unusual range and beguilingly fluent style.

Of course I can explain why I wanted to jump off the top of a tower block. I&#x2019;m not a bloody idiot. I can explain it because it wasn&#x2019;t inexplicable: It was a logical decision, the product of proper thought. It wasn&#x2019;t even very serious thought, either. I don&#x2019;t mean it was whimsical&#x2014;I just mean that it wasn&#x2019;t terribly complicated, or agonized. Put it this way: Say you were, I don&#x2019;t know, an assistant bank manager in Guildford. And you&#x2019;d been thinking of emigrating, and then you were offered the job of managing a bank in Sydney. Well, even though it&#x2019;s a pretty straightforward decision, you&#x2019;d still have to think for a bit, wouldn&#x2019;t you? You&#x2019;d at least have to work out whether you could bear to move, whether you could leave your friends and colleagues behind, whether you could uproot your wife and kids. You might sit down with a bit of paper and draw up a list of pros and cons. You know:</p> <p> </p><p> CONS: aged parents, friends, golf club </p> <p> PROS: more money, better quality of life (house with pool, barbecue, etc.), sea, sunshine, no left-wing councils banning &#x201c;Baa, Baa Black Sheep,&#x201d; no EEC directives banning British sausages, etc.</p> <p></p> <p>It&#x2019;s no contest, is it? The golf club! Give me a break. Obviously your aged parents give you pause for thought, but that&#x2019;s all it is&#x2014;a pause, and a brief one, too. You&#x2019;d be on the phone to the travel agent&#x2019;s within ten minutes.</p> <p>Well, that was me. There simply weren&#x2019;t enough regrets, and lots and lots of reasons to jump. The only things on my &#x201c;cons&#x201d; list were the kids, but I couldn&#x2019;t imagine Cindy letting me see them again anyway. I haven&#x2019;t got any aged parents, and I don&#x2019;t play golf. Suicide was my Sydney. And I say that with no offense to the good people of Sydney intended.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>MAUREEN</p><p></p><p> </p><p>I told him I was going to a New Year&#x2019;s Eve party. I told him in October. I don&#x2019;t know whether people send out invitations to New Year&#x2019;s Eve parties in October or not. Probably not. (How would I know? I haven&#x2019;t been to one since 1984. June and Brian across the road had one, just before they moved. And even then I only nipped in for an hour or so, after he&#x2019;d gone to sleep.) But I couldn&#x2019;t wait any longer. I&#x2019;d been thinking about it since May or June, and I was itching to tell him. Stupid, really. He doesn&#x2019;t understand, I&#x2019;m sure he doesn&#x2019;t. They tell me to keep talking to him, but you can see that nothing goes in. And what a thing to be itching about anyway! It just goes to show what I had to look forward to, doesn&#x2019;t it?</p> <p>The moment I told him, I wanted to go straight to confession. Well, I&#x2019;d lied, hadn&#x2019;t I? I&#x2019;d lied to my own son. Oh, it was only a tiny, silly lie: I&#x2019;d told him months in advance that I was going to a party, a party I&#x2019;d made up. I&#x2019;d made it up properly, too. I told him whose party it was, and why I&#x2019;d been invited, and why I wanted to go, and who else would be there. (It was Bridgid&#x2019;s party, Bridgid from the church. And I&#x2019;d been invited because her sister was coming over from Cork, and her sister had asked after me in a couple of letters. And I wanted to go because Bridgid&#x2019;s sister had taken her mother-in-law to Lourdes, and I wanted to find out all about it, with a view to taking Matty one day.) But confession wasn&#x2019;t possible, because I knew I would have to repeat the sin, the lie, over and over as the year came to an end. Not only to Matty, but to the people at the nursing home, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, there isn&#x2019;t anyone else, really. Maybe someone at the church, or someone in a shop. It&#x2019;s almost comical, when you think about it. If you spend day and night looking after a sick child, there&#x2019;s very little room for sin, and I hadn&#x2019;t done anything worth confessing for donkey&#x2019;s years. And I went from that, to sinning so terribly that I couldn&#x2019;t even talk to the priest, because I was going to go on sinning and sinning until the day I died, when I would commit the biggest sin of all. (And why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you&#x2019;re told that you&#x2019;ll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it&#x2019;s a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the Post Office, people tut. Or sometimes they say, Excuse me, I was here first. They don&#x2019;t say, You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity. That would be a bit strong.) It didn&#x2019;t stop me from going to the church. But I only kept going because people would think there was something wrong if I stopped.</p> <p>As we got closer and closer to the date, I kept passing on little tidbits of information that I told him I&#x2019;d picked up. Every Sunday I pretended as though I&#x2019;d learned something new, because Sundays were when I saw Bridgid. &#x201c;Bridgid says there&#x2019;ll be dancing.&#x201d; &#x201c;Bridgid&#x2019;s worried that not everyone likes wine and beer, so she&#x2019;ll be providing spirits.&#x201d; &#x201c;Bridgid doesn&#x2019;t know how many people will have eaten already.&#x201d; If Matty had been able to understand anything, he&#x2019;d have decided that this Bridgid woman was a lunatic, worrying like that about a little get-together. I blushed every time I saw her at the church. And of course I wanted to know what she actually was doing on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, but I never asked. If she was planning to have a party, she might&#x2019;ve felt that she had to invite me.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m ashamed, thinking back. Not about the lies&#x2014;I&#x2019;m used to lying now. No, I&#x2019;m ashamed of how pathetic it all was. One Sunday I found myself telling Matty about where Bridgid was going to buy the ham for the sandwiches. But it was on my mind, New Year&#x2019;s Eve, of course it was, and it was a way of talking about it, without actually saying anything. And I suppose I came to believe in the party a little bit myself, in the way that you come to believe the story in a book. Every now and again I imagined what I&#x2019;d wear, how much I&#x2019;d drink, what time I&#x2019;d leave. Whether I&#x2019;d come home in a taxi. That sort of thing. In the end it was as if I&#x2019;d actually been. Even in my imagination, though, I couldn&#x2019;t see myself talking to anyone at the party. I was always quite happy to leave it.</p> <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>JESS</p><p></p><p> </p><p>I was at a party downstairs in the squat. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it&#x2014;Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you&#x2019;d still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn&#x2019;t the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously.</p> <p>I only went because someone at college told me Chas would be there, but he wasn&#x2019;t. I tried his mobile for the one zillionth time, but it wasn&#x2019;t on. When we first split up, he called me a stalker, but that&#x2019;s like an emotive word, &#x201c;stalker,&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t it? I don&#x2019;t think you can call it stalking when it&#x2019;s just phone calls and letters and e-mails and knocking on the door. And I only turned up at his work twice. Three times, if you count his Christmas party, which I don&#x2019;t, because he said he was going to take me to that anyway. Stalking is when you follow them to the shops and on holiday and all that, isn&#x2019;t it? Well, I never went near any shops. And anyway I didn&#x2019;t think it was stalking when someone owed you an explanation. Being owed an explanation is like being owed money, and not just a fiver, either. Five or six hundred quid, minimum, more like. If you&#x2019;re owed five or six hundred quid, minimum, and the person who owes it to you is avoiding you, then you&#x2019;re bound to knock on his door late at night, when you know he&#x2019;s going to be in. People get serious about that sort of money. They call in debt collectors, and break people&#x2019;s legs, but I never went that far. I showed some restraint.</p> <p>So even though I could see straightaway that he wasn&#x2019;t at this party, I stayed for a while. Where else was I going to go? I was feeling sorry for myself. How can you be eighteen and not have anywhere to go on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, apart from some shit party in some shit squat where you don&#x2019;t know anybody? Well, I managed it. I seem to manage it every year. I make friends easily enough, but then I piss them off, I know that much, even if I&#x2019;m not sure why or how. And so people and parties disappear.</p> <p>I pissed Jen off, I&#x2019;m sure of that. She disappeared, like everyone else.</p> <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>MARTIN</p><p></p><p> </p><p>I&#x2019;d spent the previous couple of months looking up suicide inquests on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: &#x201c;He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.&#x201d; And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he&#x2019;d lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hello, Mr. Coroner? Anyone at home? I&#x2019;m sorry, but there&#x2019;s no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I&#x2019;d say he got it just right. Bad thing upon bad thing upon bad thing until you can&#x2019;t take any more, and then it&#x2019;s off to the nearest multistory car park in the family hatchback with a length of rubber tubing. Surely that&#x2019;s fair enough? Surely the coroner&#x2019;s report should read, &#x201c;He took his own life after sober and careful contemplation of the fucking shambles it had become.&#x201d;</p> <p>Not once did I read a newspaper report that convinced me that the deceased was off the old trolley. You know: &#x201c;The Manchester United forward, who was engaged to the current Miss Sweden, had recently achieved a unique Double: He is the only man ever to have won the FA Cup and an Oscar for Best Actor in the same year. The rights to his first novel had just been bought for an undisclosed sum by Steven Spielberg. He was found hanging from a beam in his stables by a member of his staff.&#x201d; Now, I&#x2019;ve never seen a coroner&#x2019;s report like that, but if there were cases in which happy, successful, talented people took their own lives, one could safely come to the conclusion that the old balance was indeed wonky. And I&#x2019;m not saying that being engaged to Miss Sweden, playing for Manchester United, and winning Oscars inoculates you against depression&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure it doesn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just saying that these things help. Look at the statistics. You&#x2019;re more likely to top yourself if you&#x2019;ve just gone through a divorce. Or if you&#x2019;re anorexic. Or if you&#x2019;re unemployed. Or if you&#x2019;re a prostitute. Or if you&#x2019;ve fought in a war, or if you&#x2019;ve been raped, or if you&#x2019;ve lost somebody&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are lots and lots of factors that push people over the edge; none of these factors are likely to make you feel anything but fucking miserable.</p> <p>Two years ago Martin Sharp would not have found himself sitting on a tiny concrete ledge in the middle of the night, looking a hundred feet down at a concrete walkway and wondering whether he&#x2019;d hear the noise that his bones made when they shattered into tiny pieces. But two years ago Martin Sharp was a different person. I still had my job. I still had a wife. I hadn&#x2019;t slept with a fifteen-year-old. I hadn&#x2019;t been to prison. I hadn&#x2019;t had to talk to my young daughters about a front-page tabloid newspaper article, an article headlined with the word SLEAZEBAG! and illustrated with a picture of me lying on the pavement outside a well-known London nightspot. (What would the headline have been if I had gone over? SLEAZY DOES IT! perhaps. Or maybe SHARP END!) There was, it is fair to say, less reason for ledge-sitting before all that happened. So don&#x2019;t tell me that the balance of my mind was disturbed, because it really didn&#x2019;t feel that way. (What does it mean, anyway, that stuff about &#x201c;the balance of the mind&#x201d;? Is it strictly scientific? Does the mind really wobble up and down in the head like some sort of fish scale, according to how loopy you are?) Wanting to kill myself was an appropriate and reasonable response to a whole series of unfortunate events that had rendered life unlivable. Oh, yes, I know the shrinks would say that they could have helped, but that&#x2019;s half the trouble with this bloody country, isn&#x2019;t it? No one&#x2019;s willing to face their responsibilities. It&#x2019;s always someone else&#x2019;s fault. Boo hoo hoo. Well, I happen to be one of those rare individuals who believe that what went on with Mummy and Daddy had nothing to do with me screwing a fifteen-year-old. I happen to believe that I would have slept with her regardless of whether I&#x2019;d been breast-fed or not, and it was time to face up to what I&#x2019;d done.</p> <p>And what I&#x2019;d done is, I&#x2019;d pissed my life away. Literally. Well, OK, not <i>literally</i> literally. I hadn&#x2019;t, you know, turned my life into urine and stored it in my bladder and so on and so forth. But I felt as if I&#x2019;d pissed my life away in the same way that you can piss money away. I&#x2019;d had a life, full of kids and wives and jobs and all the usual stuff, and I&#x2019;d somehow managed to mislay it. No, you see, that&#x2019;s not right. I knew where my life was, just as you know where money goes when you piss it away. I hadn&#x2019;t mislaid it at all. I&#x2019;d spent it. I&#x2019;d spent my kids and my job and my wife on teenaged girls and nightclubs: These things all come at a price, and I&#x2019;d happily paid it, and suddenly my life wasn&#x2019;t there anymore. What would I be leaving behind? On New Year&#x2019;s Eve, it felt as though I&#x2019;d be saying goodbye to a dim form of consciousness and a semi-functioning digestive system&#x2014;all the indications of a life, certainly, but none of the content. I didn&#x2019;t even feel sad, particularly. I just felt very stupid, and very angry.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m not sitting here now because I suddenly saw sense. The reason I&#x2019;m sitting here now is because that night turned into as much of a mess as everything else. I couldn&#x2019;t even jump off a fucking tower block without fucking it up.</p> <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>MAUREEN</p><p></p><p> </p><p>On New Year&#x2019;s Eve the nursing home sent their ambulance round for him. You had to pay extra for that, but I didn&#x2019;t mind. How could I? In the end, Matty was going to cost them a lot more than they were costing me. I was only paying for a night, and they were going to pay for the rest of his life.</p> <p>I thought about hiding some of Matty&#x2019;s stuff, in case they thought it was odd, but no one had to know it was his. I could have had loads of kids, as far as they knew, so I left it there. They came around six, and these two young fellas wheeled him out. I couldn&#x2019;t cry when he went, because then the young fellas would guess something was wrong; as far as they knew, I was coming to fetch him at eleven the next morning. I just kissed him on the top of his head and told him to be good at the home, and I held it all in until I&#x2019;d seen them leave. Then I wept and wept, for about an hour. He&#x2019;d ruined my life, but he was still my son, and I was never going to see him again, and I couldn&#x2019;t even say goodbye properly.

In this absorbing historical detective story, the acclaimed broadcaster and historian Michael Wood takes a fresh approach to Shakespeare&#39;s life, brilliantly recreating the turbulent times through which the poet lived: the age of the Reformation, the Spanish Armada, the Gunpowder Plot and the colonization of the Americas. Drawing on an extensive range of sources, Michael Wood takes us back into Elizabethan England to reveal a man who is the product of his time - a period of tremendous upheaval that straddled the medieval and modern worlds. Using a wealth of unexplored archive evidence, the author vividly conjures up the neighbourhoods of the Elizabethan London where Shakespeare lived and worked during his glittering career. Full of fresh insights and fascinating new discoveries, this book presents us with a Shakespeare for the twenty-first century: a man of the theatre, a thinking artist, playful and cunning who held up a mirror to hi sage, but who was also, as his friend Ben Jonson said, &#39;not of an age, but for all time&#39;.</p><p>Michael Wood was born in Manchester and educated at Manchester Grammar School and Oriel College, Oxford, where he did post-graduate research in Anglo-Saxon history. A broadcaster and film-maker, he is the author of several highly praised books on English history, including In Search of the Dark Ages, Domesday and recently In Search of England. He has over eight documentary films to his name, including Art of the Western World, Legacy, In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great and the highly acclaimed Conquistadors. The writer behind three BBC films about Shakespeare&#39;s early history plays, he was a contributor to Shakespearean Perspective (1985). Michael Wood is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.&#34;Wood&#39;s is an honest, well-organised account that will serve the reader well.&#34; * Independent on Sunday * &#34;Thanks to the author&#39;s gifts of story-teller, populariser and interpreter, Shakespeare&#39;s world is brought to life more vividly than in any other biography of him I have read. All the latest professional scholarship on the question on Shakespeare and Catholicism is effectively incorporated in the book, but where Wood has made genuine finds of his own is in the area of the dramatist&#39;s day-to-day life.&#34; * Sunday Telegraph * &#34;In this enthralling book Michael Wood evokes the physical and intellectual environment in which Shakespeare lived and worked with vivid and original immediacy.&#34; -- Professor Stanley Wells, Editor of The Oxford Shakespeare &#34;Wood is a perceptive, entertaining and enthusiastic companion.&#34; * Sunday Times * &#34;Shakespeare emerges from the book as the master general he must have been.&#34; -- Clive James * Times Literary Supplement *</p><h2>Mouse and Dragon (Liaden Universe)</h2><p>The sequel to <i>Saltation</i>, a new novel in the breakout Liaden Universe� space opera series with a huge and active base of fans!&nbsp; A young heroine and the future co-leader of her star-faring clan battle nefarious forces from within the empire that threaten her family and her man.&nbsp; <b></b><br><br>Aelliana Caylon has escaped her abusive family.

Based on years of conversations with students, this approachable theological introduction to the Christian doctrine of holiness challenges the commonly held idea that holiness is primarily a moral category. The author explains that holiness is grounded not in ethics but in the basic nature of God; it is essentially and exclusively a divine property. The book highlights the Bible&#39;s necessary and corrective role in defining holiness and shows how individual holiness is grounded in the community that is the church catholic.</p><p>"Holiness is a nearly forgotten concept in my church. That's a great pity. The Wesleyan conviction that God is able to draw us into ever closer fellowship with the Trinity and that our thoughts and deeds are transformed in the process--holiness--is the force that drove the Methodist revival. Holiness is what a living, loving God is and does. Van De Walle has written a remarkable book that gives fresh, contemporary, practical significance to the idea of holiness. Here's a book that my church needs to read, ponder, and inculcate now that we may go with God into God's future."<br>--<b>Will Willimon</b>, Duke Divinity School; United Methodist Bishop, retired<br><br>"Van De Walle speaks to a church confused about how salvation shapes one's life in Christ. He gives us a fine introduction to a belief once so core to the Christian faith, but now so forgotten. After reading it, I came away with fresh eyes for what it might mean not just to be saved in Christ but to be transformed in Christ."<br>--<b>David Fitch</b>, Northern Seminary; author of <i>Faithful Presence</i><br><br>"<i>Rethinking Holiness</i> brings forward an important conversation that addresses how the Christian community can demonstrate the holiness of God in the present cultural context. Recovering the concept of holiness--not as insider jargon but as good news for the world for which Jesus died--Van De Walle supplies theological reflection that invites the reader to better articulate and proclaim the scriptural witness to the God made known in Jesus. I've been waiting for this conversation, and <i>Rethinking Holiness</i> brings it front and center."<br>--<b>Joy&nbsp;J. Moore</b>, Wesley Seminary, Indiana Wesleyan University<br><br>"The power of holiness as a description of God's nature captivates the heart and compels us to participate. It's almost as if we are seeing holiness for the first time. Bernie carefully and thoughtfully strips away the layers of insulation that have kept holiness locked in a time warp of irrelevance and lays before us the glory of God's transcendence in life-changing clarity. He does all of this with the implicit nudge to participate in God's holiness so that we are transformed. Holiness has never been more compelling, life giving, and desirable."<br>--<b>Kevin&nbsp;W.

Chima lives in Ohio with her husband and two sons.In this companion to The Warrior Heir (Hyperion, 2006), orphaned Seph, 16, is an untrained wizard who can fling fire from his fingertips. After one of his many accidental fires kills a friend, he&#39;s sent to a secluded boys&#39; school in Maine. The headmaster, Dr. Leicester, a powerful wizard, offers to train him. Initially, Seph agrees but then changes his mind after he&#39;s nearly forced to participate in an initiation where he&#39;s made to swear an oath to Leicester and allow him to link Seph&#39;s power to his. For refusing, Leicester tortures Seph with hallucinatory dreams that nearly drive him insane. When he finally finds a way to communicate with the outside world, Linda Downey, an enchanter, rescues him and takes him to the town of Trinity, OH, a sanctuary for wizards and other members of magical guilds. There, he meets many of the characters who appeared in the first book, including Jack Swift, Ellen Stephenson, and Leander Hastings, as well as a new character, Madison, who can draw power from wizards. Seph and his new friends must find a way to stop an impending war between the two great wizard houses. This exciting page-turner is darker than The Warrior Heir and, because of its depiction of Leicester&#39;s love of inflicting pain and frequent violence, is more appropriate for older readers.

Growing up, he built airplane models and dreamed about soaring over the earth. When he was twelve, his mom treated him to a flying lesson at the local airfield. Taken on a short flight by an instructor and allowed to operate the controls for part of the flight, he was hooked forever. It wasn't until he was running low on college funds and saw a recruiter at his college that he joined the Marines and began the journey towards his dream from Parris Island to Bravo Company and, then, officer training school. One day at an airfield when President Reagan landed on this way to a fundraiser, Frenchy's life changed forever when encountered HMX1, the squadron that flies the President in Marine One. When he saw the white-topped Sea King and White Hawk helicopters, he was determined to become part of that elite group. Inside Marine One is Col. L'Heureux's inspiring story of a young man who dreamed of flying, trained, studied and worked hard to become the pilot who ended up serving four US Presidents - George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It's also a personal guided tour inside the world's most famous helicopter by a man who knows that flying machine better than any other. Inside Marine One is a great American success story of a young boy who dreamed big, worked hard and finally flew the President of the United States as his number one passenger.</p></p><p><p>COL.

A couple of years before that, my parents bought a three-story, sixteen-room, old Greek Revival&#x2013;style house in historic Salem, about fifteen miles north of Boston. My dad was an electrical engineer. My mom was a devoted, hardworking homemaker, and they planned to fill the place with kids. That agenda seemed to work out perfectly, because I am the third of seven siblings. My sister Yvonne and my brother Roger are older than I. My sister Marilyn was born next, followed by my three brothers, Marc, Tommy, and Paul.</p> <p>The house was built in the mid-1800s, and I imagine my parents must have thought that its location and size outweighed its age and impracticality. The style resembled a miniature Parthenon&#x2014;a mint-green box with white trim and a peaked roof. For a long time, my sisters shared a room, Roger and I shared a room, and the three younger brothers shared another one. As we got older, we spread out into our own spaces, but in the early years my parents consolidated all of us kids, you might say, in that big old house. From a hundred feet up, the roof with its two chimneys would have just blended in with thousands of others, jutting out from the thousands of trees standing sentinel over our storied town, best known for the witch trials held there in the late seventeenth century and a certain house with seven gables.</p> <p>It was one of those houses that any kid would love to grow up in. There were so many rooms and stairwells and alcoves and they all provided endless opportunities for fort-building and hiding. I&#x2019;ll never forget those spots where I could hide forever&#x2014;just me and my scraped knees surrounded by the look and feel of our house&#x2019;s beautiful old woodwork. When you walked in the front door, there was a formal staircase with a large banister that twisted up in a pattern of squared turns all the way to the top. I could stand on the first floor and look all the way up. At the back end of the house was another stairway, originally a service stairway, which rose from the kitchen to the top floor. That one was enclosed. With sixteen rooms, three bedrooms, a basement, and two stairwells, hide-and-seek was elevated to a varsity level.</p> <p>Almost all my family members were musically inclined, and most of them played several instruments. While I always loved music, and while the memories of Dave Brubeck through the whole house on Saturday mornings are very dear to me, I just didn&#x2019;t get the musical gene. In a house full of musicians, I was the only one who didn&#x2019;t play an instrument or sing harmony. However, as early as the age of six or seven, I was obsessed with the idea of being a pilot. Logan Airport was due south of us, and I looked up into the sky over my neighborhood and watched countless planes going in and out of Boston.</p> <p>I remember one airline that painted their planes bright yellow, and I loved to watch the big metal birds leave their contrails across the sky, imagining I was their pilot. At the time, the airline industry was growing and the wide-bodied jet was coming into fruition. McDonnell Douglas had their big DC-10, Boeing had the 747 jet, and Lockheed Martin had the L-1011. Just the sheer power and size of those aircraft fascinated me. Even though this was near the end of the Vietnam War, I wasn&#x2019;t really interested in high-performance aircraft yet. I was enamored with the whole commercial-airline industry and loved those big wide-bodied jets. By this time I had my own room overlooking the backyard and the walls were plastered with pictures of my heroes&#x2014;pilots like Chuck Yeager and Amelia Earhart, and astronauts like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.</p> <p>Eventually, it wasn&#x2019;t enough to see the planes way up in the sky or on TV or even in my imagination. I wanted to get my hands on them. I would walk with my friends down to the local department store, Almy&#x2019;s, and check out the model airplanes made by a company called Revell. I started saving up my allowance and birthday money and even raking leaves or shoveling snow to earn money. I pretty much spent my money on model airplanes and movies. Some of the original models were pretty simple, but so much fun. I had a small mahogany school desk in my room, and I turned this into my work center. My dad gave me one of those gooseneck lamps, which stood in the corner of the desk.</p> <p>If you ever made model airplanes or cars, you&#x2019;ll probably remember the excitement of opening the box. They always had cool photos on the lid and they always had that new-car smell when you started taking the parts out. I liked to open each box carefully and set it on its side near the edge of the desk so I always had a picture of what the plane should look like when I was done. The parts were shrink-wrapped, and I did my own inventory as I spread the parts out and read the instructions. Some of the smaller ones were mostly just an exercise in snapping parts together. They only took about ten or fifteen minutes to assemble, but I enjoyed the small parts, the precision required, and the smell of the paint.</p> <p>My buddy Brad was a model-car freak and had quite a collection. Sometimes I packed up my collection in a box and transported it to Brad&#x2019;s house, where we would compare our craftsmanship. He showed me his model Mustangs or Barracudas, and the overall quality and precision always looked so much better than my airplanes. He knew how to use matches to create the look of exhaust and road grime on the tire wells, and he taught me that using spray paint was the way to go, especially on the larger parts.</p> <p>I went through the first dozen models pretty fast and also made a lot of those simple balsa-wood glider planes. Whether it was gluing pennies to the nose to add stability or creating my own unique little rotors on the tail wings, I tried every imaginable experiment. I launched many wooden planes out my window, harassing the chickens that my dad always had in the backyard. After a while, there were a 747 and a couple of biplanes hanging at various angles from my ceiling. It was my own private aerodrome. I could soar, in my imagination, to my heart&#x2019;s content. While the rest of my family slept, I flew over the United States, across the Atlantic, all the way over Europe and Asia, crossing the Pacific and landing back in Salem. Here&#x2019;s the thing, though: I never built a helicopter.&#x2026; </p> <p>I built and built and graduated into more-complex models. I remember one day buying a DC-10 replica. I had saved some money, and I walked to Almy&#x2019;s department store and bought the plane. It felt like ten miles but it was probably only a few blocks. When I got home, I ran straight up to my room and got started. I opened the box and started pulling out all the parts. It was an American Airlines jet.</p> <p>Over the next couple of weeks, the project became a competing priority with everything, even my homework. On the weekends, when my brothers and sisters were running around, I was in my room with my model airplane. I was late for dinner a few times, and in my household that was a capital crime. After assembling and painting every little detail, even the seats in the passenger area, I put the finishing touches on the exterior paint job with a can of spray paint in the backyard. As soon as it was dry, I carried it back up to my room and set it on my desk on its landing gear. I stood back and surveyed my work. It looked beautiful. It was kind of like the moment when Ralphie, in the movie <i>A Christmas Story,</i> finally got his Red Rider BB gun. I considered my building of that beautiful DC-10 model one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. Even then, as I looked at the completed model, I was thinking about the day when I&#x2019;d get to sit in the cockpit and fly a plane just like that.</p> <p>My First Time in the Sky</p> <p>Probably every boy dreams of flying at one point, but very few ever have the chance to do it. One spring morning when I was twelve, I was sitting at the breakfast table with the whole family before school. It was a Monday, and as a kid that was not my favorite morning&#x2014;an interruption to my weekend daydreams.</p> <p>While everyone rushed to shovel food into their mouths and get out the door, my mother, a woman with blue eyes and auburn hair, smirked knowingly into her cereal for a few minutes before announcing, &#x201c;Well, I won something in the church drawing yesterday, and I&#x2019;ve decided to give it to Ray.&#x201d;</p> <p>I stopped spooning my Lucky Charms and looked up at her. &#x201c;You did?&#x201d;</p> <p>Smiling, she said, &#x201c;Yes, and guess what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a free flying lesson in a real airplane!&#x201d;</p> <p>In the next instant I was jumping up and down, my arms wrapped around her, saying &#x201c;thank you, thank you&#x201d; over and over. I caught some jealous looks from my siblings at first, but I think they all understood how much flying would mean to me, and they never said a thing. It was excruciating going to school that day&#x2014;all I could think about was flying.</p> <p>I kept bugging my mom for every little detail about the plane all week. When Saturday finally rolled around, the whole family came along on the drive out to the Beverly, Massachusetts, Municipal Airport, which was more like an airstrip for small planes. We met the pilot instructor, a tall guy who was probably in his late twenties. He towered over me, with dark hair like mine and a serious expression that would break from time to time into a smile. Since he was the first real pilot I had ever met in person, I quickly added him to my growing list of personal heroes.</p> <p>While my parents filled out some paperwork, I kept looking out the airport office windows at the little white Piper Cherokee with red stripes I&#x2019;d soon be flying in. It was a tiny, single-engine plane with just enough room for a pilot, a copilot, and a little bit of cargo in the back, yet it dwarfed the model planes that covered the shelves in my room, and to me, that made it larger than life.</p> <p>The pilot brought me into a small classroom in the back of the main terminal to discuss some of the safety precautions and other requirements. I wasn&#x2019;t expecting this part. I just wanted to fly. I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking around at the posters with safety messages and illustrations of aviation instruments and planes.</p> <p>I was trying to pay attention, and nodding along with whatever he was saying, when suddenly he got very serious, bent down, and said, &#x201c;If I tell you we have an emergency, I want you to do nothing but sit on your hands. If I have already issued you the controls, I will take them back from you. I need you to say nothing and sit on your hands.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t joking.</p> <p>I had never flown in a plane before, so when we walked out to the runway, it was the closest I had ever come to a real aircraft. He escorted me around the plane, which was only about twenty to twenty-five feet, and when we finally sat down in the cockpit, our shoulders were touching. I was speechless before the shiny, intricate detail of the instruments. My entire field of view was dominated by this huge instrument panel, and I could hardly see over it. These levers and dials and pedals and switches were all new to me. I wanted to click, push, pull, and press everything.</p> <p>I was trying to act grown-up as the instructor gave me a brief orientation to the main controls. I kept nodding to indicate that I was paying attention, but I just wanted to fly! Then he started the engines and began to taxi toward the runway. We moved slowly. The sound of the engine roared in my ears. I kept one eye on the scene ahead of me, the runway rolling quickly below us, and the other eye on the pilot&#x2019;s hands. He began to pick up speed. He got faster and faster and, all at once, he lifted us off the ground! I felt that lift in my stomach. I was in the sky! I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. After building all those models and dreaming of being a pilot soaring over the earth, I was in the sky!</p> <p>There was a set of tandem controls, typical in general-aviation airplanes. Once we were airborne, he let me handle the controls for a while and I could feel the plane respond when I pushed forward or pulled back or otherwise manipulated the controls, causing the plane to climb, dive, or roll. I could feel how sensitive the controls were to my touch. The pilot gave me some pointers, and I think I was a fast learner, but my strongest memory of that day was the view. For the next hour, we flew over our little town.</p> <p>He pointed out certain landmarks and neighborhoods I barely recognized, and then we flew over my house, my school, and my friends&#x2019; houses. From that altitude, my town looked like one of those towns you see under a Christmas tree with a toy train circling it. Even the Beverly Airport looked tiny from that elevation. At takeoff, the airport runway looked enormous. It was the biggest runway I&#x2019;d ever seen. From that altitude, it was just a gray strip of asphalt carved into a field of green.</p> <p>After maybe half an hour, the pilot took back the controls, and I sat wide-eyed as we drew closer to the runway. We got lower and lower. I was a little afraid, but I knew the pilot was in control. My family, below, slowly got larger, pointing up and clapping for me, my little brother Tommy jumping up and down. I felt like a hero. The pilot landed gently. I noticed the way he put the brakes on and stopped the plane exactly where he wanted. His control was incredible. After that day there was no doubt what I wanted to do with my life; I was hooked on flying. I wanted to be a pilot, just like that guy.</p> <p>That was one day I&#x2019;ll never forget. As I got older, making model airplanes gradually was replaced, as it is with a lot of boys, by thinking a lot about girls. What can I say? It happens. I was starting to date and hanging out more with my friends, but one thing never changed: my dream of becoming a pilot. It only became stronger and stayed with me no matter what girl I met or friend I made. That day at the Beverly Municipal Airport gave me my goal in life.</p> <p>A College with Wings</p> <p>Life rolled on and I grew up, pretty much like any other guy. Between my sophomore and junior years of high school, my family moved to New Hampshire. I always had a job and was working as a dishwasher at the time, and I was almost sixteen. Seeing a way to use my dishwashing skills to hang out with friends and meet girls, I had signed up to work as part of the kitchen staff at a girls&#x2019; summer camp. I mean, how great was that? A job <i>and</i> girls! I went there right after school let out that year. When the camp was over, my family picked me up and we drove to the new house in New Hampshire. All my boxes had been stuffed into my new room. I went off to the camp from Salem, Massachusetts and came back to a new neighborhood, a new high school, and a new city in New Hampshire.</p> <p>I got a job as a waiter in one of the local restaurants, started dating a bit more seriously, and moved toward my final year of high school. And I still had no doubt about what I wanted to be. My dad wanted me to go to Boston College, but I had other plans. Even though there were more-inexpensive colleges nearby, such as the University of New Hampshire, I had my eyes on a private school called Nathaniel Hawthorne, which had a flight program. The idea of joining the military didn&#x2019;t even cross my mind.</p> <p>I had been drooling over the college brochure, which featured scenic photos of the campus in the fall, and the DC-3 aircraft that was the workhorse of their flight program. When the school started advertising an open house for prospective students, my parents really didn&#x2019;t want to go, so I persuaded a couple of my buddies to go with me. We drove up for the open house and received a quick tour of the campus, which was very green and appealing to me.

Learn more about Adam Hamilton at AdamHamilton.org.Hamilton's style is at once smooth,easy reading and yet has a way of sneaking up on you with the issues raised. I found myself rereading parts so that I really had the idea because it made me think well beyond the box. He brings a wealth of understanding of that period of history and places the last day in proper perspective to the times. He also does not mince words about conditions during the rule of the Romans and he includes details of the customs of the time as well. Hamilton guides us through the last day of Christ's life on earth in human form and encourages us to put ourselves in the position of every major character who had a major impact on the proceedings. We are Judas, Peter, John, Pilate, the Council, and others. We are asked to seriously consider our humanly weaknesses, our prejudices, and our plan to become even closer to God and move ourselves further along our faith walk. This work is especially significant during the Lenten season, but I would not limit my reading to just that period. We need to be constantly reminded of the many lessons and thoughts that Hamilton raises through this small reading. Highly recommended for older teens through adults. --By C. Sharon-matthews (Bourne, MA USA) - This review is from: 24 Hours That Changed the World (Hardcover)<br><br>Adam Hamilton has written a book that clearly explains the events of Holy Week. He is especially good at explaining the atmosphere surrounding the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He takes a balanced approach in his discussion providing an unbiased explanation of the arrest and crucifixion. As a pastor, I found this book so excellent that I plan on using this as the basis for next year's mid-week Lenten services.

And while it has implications for your work or occupation, it also reaches wider. It includes your giftedness, your weakness, your life in community, what you do day to day. In this book, Gordon Smith invites you to discover your vocation by listening to God and becoming a coworker with him. <ul> <li>What is my calling?</li> <li>How do I live it out in the midst of difficult relationships or moral challenges?</li> <li>Will my vocation change as I enter a new stage of life?</li> <li>As I cope with competing needs and demands, how can I craft a balanced, ordered way of living?</li> <li>Where do I find the courage to follow God's call?</li> </ul> Smith addresses these questions and many more, pointing the way in this book toward freedom--and toward emotional and spiritual maturity. If you long to hear and follow God's call to you, here is the book that can get you started.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<i>Courage &amp; Calling</i> guides readers on the fulfilling journey toward self-discovery. Smith opens by acknowledging that Christians realize God has called them first to Himself--to know and follow Him--but he wonders how many learn that God has also called them to a specific purpose--a particular reason for being--and he invites readers to discover their vocation by listening to God and becoming coworkers with Him. . . . Helps readers locate their giftings and define their callings, enabling them to fulfill their God-given destiny. It's recommended reading for anyone grappling with their place in life, but it's likely to appeal especially to graduates and young professionals and could also be used as a resource by educators and guidance counselors. -- <i>Christian Retailing, Jan. 20, 2000</i><br><br>Smith, a Regent College dean, targets 20-somethings with a blueprint for identifying their specific calling (a vocation unique to each person), which he differentiates from the general call to salvation and an immediate call to daily tasks. Smith provides a theological foundation for identifying vocation. Then he focuses on vocational excellence, which is achieved through courage, wisdom, moral integrity, gratitude, humility, and patience. Recommended to those seeking vocational guidance in early adulthood or during a midlife re-evaluation. It's also a valuable resource for educators, counselors, and pastors. -- <i>CBA Marketplace, February 2000</i></p><h2>Hello Kitty A Collection For Early readers (Hello Kitty Early Readers)</h2><p>Seven Books in one collection.

During CREED&#x2019;s decade of dominance and in the years following the band&#x2019;s breakup, Scott struggled with drugs and alcohol, which led not only to a divorce, but also to a much-publicized suicide attempt in 2006.

The result is not only a gripping memoir but also a rare and candid look at the dark and often turbulent world of rock and roll.The story of a small-town boy rocketing to fame only to lose it all in a flurry of drugs and alcohol is not a new one, especially in the world of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. Kudos then to Stapp, who, with the help of veteran music writer and biographer Ritz, makes his own story a compelling one. The former singer of the once hugely popular rock band Creed, Stapp is a devout Christian who was raised in a fundamentalist home ruled by an abusive stepfather. That background proved to be fertile ground for the creativity and complex relationship with faith that continues to define Stapp as a musician and songwriter to this day. His journey from musician on the rise to rock star spinning out of control is given depth when examined through the lens of his often less-than-perfect faith. Unfortunately, later chapters seem to lack that same close introspection, and readers may feel that Stapp glosses over certain events that could cast him in too critical a light. Nevertheless, those curious to discover what happened to the singer of a once ubiquitous band should be pleased with this offering. --Taina Lagodzinski</p><h2>Loving the Questions: An Exploration of the Nicene Creed</h2><p><li>Who is God? </li> <li>Who is the Creator? </li> <li>Who is the Christ? </li> <li>What is Salvation? </li> <li>Who is God the Spirit? </li> <li>What is the Church? </li> <li>What is Baptism? </li> <li>What is our future? <br> <br> <i>Loving the Questions</i> is a series of reflections on the questions raised by the Nicene Creed, a fourth-century statement of the Christian faith still used regularly in worship in churches around the world. Taking us through the creed step-by-step, Marianne Micks not only poses the questions most asked by contemporary Christians, but also teaches us to delight in the questions themselves. Faith accompanied by doubt, she believes, is far healthier that faith that never asks "why?" In short, accessible chapters Micks informs us of the historical background of the Nicene Creed and reminds us of the creed's theological, communal, and personal relevance today. </li></p><p>MARIANE MICKS was professor of biblical and historical theology at Virginia Theological Seminary and the author of numerous books in her lifetime, including Introduction to Theology, The Future Present: The Phenomenology of Christian Worship, The Joy of Worship, and Deep Waters: An Introduction to Baptism.</p><h2>The Beatles and Philosophy: Nothing You Can Think that Can&#39;t Be Thunk (Popular Culture and Philosophy, 25)</h2><p>The most popular musical group of all time, the Beatles also brought serious thought to the bubble gum-scented world of pop and rock music, with adventurous, profound, and sometimes mysterious lyrics that veered from the deliberate absurdity of I Am the Walrus&#x201d; to the rosy Rousseau-like fantasy of When I&#x2019;m 64&#x201d; to the darkly existential/nihilist visions of Eleanor Rigby&#x201d; and A Day in the Life.&#x201d; In this lively new book, 20 Beatles-loving philosophers offer fresh insight into the lives and words of the Fab Four. Among the topics investigated are the groups&#x2019; critique of consumer culture; John Lennon and the Cold War; Paul McCartney&#x2019;s philosophy of love, community, and politics; the Beatles&#x2019; struggle against the inauthentic; the ethics of chemically changed states of consciousness; the metaphysical standing of popularized Eastern meditation; and skepticism in the Beatles&#x2019; worldview.

Seven characters (including the Author himself) exchange a novel's worth of letters during a 7-month period in 1969, a time of revolution that recalls the U.S.'s first revolution in the 18th century - the heyday of the epistolary novel. Recapitulating American history as well as the plots of his first six novels, Barth's seventh novel is a witty and profound exploration of the nature of revolution and renewal, rebellion and reenactment, at both the private and public levels. It is also an ingenious meditation on the genre of the novel itself, recycling an older form to explore new directions, new possibilities for the novel.JOHN BARTH&#39;s fiction has won the National Book Award, the PEN/Malamud Award, and the Lannan Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.

E. Sue Blume shows how incest is often at the root of such problems as depression, sexual and eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and phobias and panic disorders. Using this information and the author's guidance, survivors can identify themselves, develop alternative, nondestructive survival techniques and begin again on a new path toward a rich and empowered life.</p><p>A therapist who works with incest victims, Blume offers help, advice, and support while exploring in depth the devastation wrought by this crime. She expands the definition of incest to include sexual abuse perpetrated by any caregiver (including teachers, relatives, or neighbors). Her book is written for those who know that they have been abused as well as those who have blocked such abuse from their memories. The "Incest Survivor Aftereffects Checklist" describes the many ways incest affects its victims. Using the concepts delineated in the checklist Blume explores how victims protect themselves against awareness that cannot be faced through aftereffects such as dreams, addictions, and interpersonal issues. She then offers numerous specific suggestions for recovery, including descriptions and evaluations of therapeutic interventions in the final chapter.<br><i>- Jodith Janes, Cleveland Clinic Foundation</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Addressed to victims of incest--here defined to include sexual abuse by friends or caregivers--this is a realistic and sensitive study. New York psychotherapist Blume speaks to victims who have blocked childhood memories of abuse, and sets out to help them cope with "Post-Incest Syndrome," which encompasses depression, guilt, substance addiction and sexual dysfunction. Survivors will also benefit from the author's perceptive advice on rebuilding self-esteem as a preparation for resuming friendships and sexual relations. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Pirate: A Father, His Son, and the Golden Age of Marijuana</h2><p><p><b>In the tradition of <i>Blow</i> and <i>Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, The Last Pirate</i> is a vivid, haunting and often hilarious memoir recounting the life of Big Tony, a family man who joined the biggest pot ring of the Reagan era and exploded his life in the process.

His eyes crossed as he brought the flame to his cigarette, puffed once, and went back to staring. He had been staring all night, looking out through the feathery darkness beyond the bar where dozens of young women bounced and twirled, rallying to and fro in daubed-on clothes.<br><br>He could see the dance floor in the middle distance, slightly elevated toward an already low ceiling. The sounds of Shannon and Culture Club bounded and rebounded. Then &#x201c;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&#x201d; came on and the effect of the first note on the crowd was like spray from a hose. A friend of my father&#x2019;s, a coke wholesaler with a pencil-thin mustache, threw him an apologetic look and jumped into the fray.<br><br>Anthony Edward Dokoupil was known for his on-the-job sanity. If he was working, he was happy and healthy, drug-free, focused, flowing, time bouncing off him. He had enough hair on his chest to float a gold chain, his belly was trim, and when he walked he swung his legs in loose semicircles, exuding a practiced magnetism, a put-on air of immortality. Even sitting down he pumped out so much animal energy that my mother used to say he had shark&#x2019;s blood: immune to disease, fearsomely alive, buoyant so long as he kept moving.<br><br>It was the close of the 1984 pot season, the harshest of my father&#x2019;s long career. It was October and he was back in Miami, tired and disappointed, his body quiet, all his energies turned inward. He was angry at himself for letting some incipient late-night needs throw off his judgment; embarrassed about a botched stash house and a car crash; worried about security cameras that must have caught him running through the lobby of a hotel with a box of money. All eighteen thousand pounds of weed had been sold, nothing lost, no one arrested. But he had broken the pirate code, the bylaws of his life, nowhere written down but known by all, and he had three months to sit still and stew about it.<br><br>My father was also expected home. He had a work-life conflict, a problem so mundane that it was hardly a problem at all, and might even be a blessing. But it dragged my father into a state of furious resentment. He loved us, would die for us, but go home to us? Sometimes it was asking too much.<br><br>So he sat in a private club in Coconut Grove and continued to drink, reaching the snapped lime in the bottom of another gin and tonic, not even looking up when a familiar smell drifted into his range. When a joint burns it gives up the ghost of every day it grew in the equatorial sun, every bright and gorgeous ray of sun, every grain of soil. The smoke bounces off the back of the throat and envelops the nervous system, washing through the smoker like a warm tide.<br><br>From the mid-Atlantic states to Maine and as far west as Colorado, people at that very moment could smoke my father&#x2019;s weed and feel their socks loosen and their scalp tighten and all the stress of the day wash clear. Usually my father loved to picture the end consumer. The best man with the full coat pocket. The college kid with the stash in his glove compartment. Even the high schooler, yes, the kid on drugs, the mop-top with the Kinks on the stereo, a towel stuffed under the door, and a can of Glade in his hand.<br><br>Six million joints but no freedom for the man who sold them?<br><br>My father didn&#x2019;t think that was fair.<br><br>He thought of his partner Bobby, a Brooklyn garbageman who retired into marijuana sales, out making Manhattan his playground. He thought of Charlie and Willy, his contacts in the Caribbean, near the bottom of a Heineken, their hearts like steel drums, feet stomping seashells at some dockside bar. Finally, he thought of the everyday gawkers outside on South Bayshore Drive. People in rental cars nosing out of the lot at Dinner Key. Teenagers in Mohawk haircuts, kid siblings in Mickey Mouse ears. Moms and dads in pleated shorts, striped shirts, and leather sandals. People with such lives looked south on Bayshore and through tired eyes they saw it, rising brightly above a series of thatched outdoor bars and a glowing cobalt swimming pool: the Mutiny Hotel at Sailboat Bay, the scene of my father&#x2019;s sulk.<br><br>The Mutiny was the start of the American drug world, and though it was a generally safe place it swam with suspicion and sex and incipient violence, a palpable energy that attracted a romantic class of criminal. The most famous were South American cocaine dealers. They were unsmiling businessmen who slid into the banquet tables against the wall and hid a gun in the dinner rolls. My father&#x2019;s kind were rarer: the gringos, the grass dealers, the smugglers who tied off catamarans or cruising yachts, hair tussled, Top-Siders squeaking across the bow. America used to produce men like these, pool-hall handsome, caddish, light-minded men, the source of America&#x2019;s fun if not her pride.<br><br>My father was proud to be one of them, gathered into what looked like a four-star restaurant merged with a disco and crossed with a Hong Kong sex lair. He wore white linen pants and what has to be one of the only short-sleeve V-neck sweaters in existence. The carpet beneath his slip-ons was blue and shaggy. By the door to the pool, on the path to another bar, a single vulnerable orchid performed in a pin spot of light. For aristocrats there was a harpist in a G-string, replaced at midnight by roving jugglers and mimes, and finally topless dancers. What did it feel like to walk into such a world, a young father with an envelope of coke in his pants, a bag of cash at his service? The pull of other worlds weakened and then vanished, a feeling like flying, like staring out the oval window of an airplane the instant it leaves the land where you were born.<br><br>By 1:00 a.m. my father had forgotten his woes, swallowed his conflicts, and slid off his barstool. He was celebrating his six million joints. He couldn&#x2019;t tell anyone that&#x2019;s what he was doing, but it was easy to see whose load had come in, because they were handing out drugs like cigars when a baby is born. The night became a cocktail of jungle paintings, conga lines, pelican-faced crooners, and women with shimmery, minnow-shaped earrings.<br><br>Along about 3:00 a.m. was my father&#x2019;s pumpkin hour, when he rented a room upstairs. He invited what girls he could and hired those he couldn&#x2019;t. He heard the ding of the elevator, the click-clack of high heels on buffed marble. His room was as high as possible and facing the ocean, so no one could look in, and he and his friends could be naked for days.<br><br>Out on the balcony he let his senses fill with the creak of lazily swaying traffic lights, the smell of night-blooming jasmine. He watched the usual mayday flares streak skyward and, if he is anything like me, he followed a thought in his mind, the one we all have when it&#x2019;s late and the view is of everything, the one that&#x2019;s been reverberating in my brain ever since: How the hell did I get here?<br>Fourteen years earlier, in the winter of 1970, my father was staring out on a very different body of water. He was sleeping in an uninsulated cabin on Long Island Sound, waking only to watch the waves crisscross to nowhere and back again. Outside his door the euphoria of the Summer of Love had worn off. In the course of the past two years there had been well over a hundred politically inspired bombings, not including arson and vandalism.<br><br>The authorities responded with a violent spree of their own. They donned riot gear and whirled nightsticks. Bullets tore through clothes, pierced soft flesh, and exited slick into a sunny day. The first student died at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1969. Four more perished at Kent State a year later.<br><br>It was all too much for my father, a man who pukes when he sees puke and is so queasy around illness and human frailty that he would sooner leave the room than sign your cast. He resigned from Students for a Democratic Society, quit a graduate program at the University of Detroit, and came east to the Connecticut coast for a new adventure.<br><br>At first he shacked up with a couple of hard-drinking acquaintances, a dirty-haired married couple. They spent their hours moving full bottles of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s out of one case and slipping empties into another. It was factory-like alcoholism, orderly oblivion. In my father&#x2019;s considered opinion, it was uninspired behavior.<br><br>He had been an English major and a philosophy minor, and he was acutely aware of his own image, found romance in his own dissolution. He wasn&#x2019;t alone in this strange endeavor. As the decade progressed, thousands of middle-class white kids--spared the bread lines and tank brigades of earlier generations--swore allegiance to their own stories, trying to shape their lives into some sort of gorgeous experience. My father did this more self-consciously than most.<br><br>He read Norman Mailer on the &#x201c;enormous present&#x201d; in black America. He adored Jack Kerouac&#x2019;s alter ego in On the Road, a man who strolls through the magically lilac-scented slums of Denver, &#x201c;feeling that the best the white world had offered was not enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness, music, not enough night.&#x201d; He read Allen Ginsberg and felt like Howl was about him and him alone, dragging himself through Harlem streets at dawn looking for &#x201c;an angry fix.&#x201d;<br><br>My father had picked up a smack habit a few years earlier, memorizing the lyrics of &#x201c;Heroin&#x201d; by Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. He was a contemporary of the New York author Jim Carroll, who was also a devout user in the late 1960s, and who described it as &#x201c;just such a pleasure to tie up above that mainline with a woman&#x2019;s silk stocking and hit the mark and watch the blood rise into the dropper like a certain desert lily I remember . . . so red . . . yeah, I shoot desert lilies in my arm.&#x201d; My father began to call it &#x201c;getting pinned.&#x201d; As in a thousand angels on the head.<br><br>He moved into the beach cabin to soothe mind and body alike. He hoped to beat the habit, which he had tried and failed to do a few times before. Drugs are known for their destructive potential, but in the dance of starting and stopping and starting again my father found a never-ending dream of renewal, the future full of possibility, potential, the pleasure of becoming. As the basis for a life, he thought, it was as good as any.<br><br>His cabin was actually a beach bungalow on the grounds of a summer resort. He had been hired as the off-season security guard, an inspired choice by the management. My father relished the way winter attacked a basic clapboard abode on the Connecticut coast. When he got cold, he sat in his used mint-green Dodge Dart and added songs to the sound track of his life. When he tired of watching the waves, he walked to the Beachcomber, local watering hole of the counterculture.<br><br>The walls were decorated with dusty nets and plastic aquatic life. The bar was unvarnished and uncomfortable with wobbly stools and no brass footrest. But the crowd&#x2019;s personal style ran toward a blend of Johnny Appleseed and Elvis. One of the regulars wore a brown coat with dangling leather fringe. My father sipped rum and coke and swayed to the Doors, scoping out the scene. Every song he heard, every conversation, seemed calibrated to give him the impression that the sadder he was, the smarter he was--but wipe away the generational honey-glaze, and really he had reasons to feel depressed. He had no friends, no future, and a frigid, withdrawal-wracked present without end. He started looking at every woman who walked in as though she might save him. Almost unbelievably, one did.<br>My mother, Ann, grew up in one of the wealthier suburbs of New York City. She was born in 1950, the first of five siblings in a home of smooth surfaces and a neighborhood of the same. Her father, Louis, was an abstemious, hardworking man who played minor-league baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943, and then joined the army and saw a bit of war. He was part of a tank brigade for a while, and his experiences yielded one or two concerned postcards, according to family lore, but the defining experience was a good job on the base driving the commander around and playing Saturday baseball games in Texas.<br><br>Back home he took over a small family grocery and liquor store, and ran the shop with the care of a founder, not an inheritor. He worked long hours and never drank from the stock or borrowed from the till. He was such a clean whistle that he even loathed his Italian heritage because it inspired so many whispered connections to the Mob. He refused Italian food, forbid his kids from speaking the language, and showed his love in the unspoken style of so many mid-century fathers. For one thing, he taught them how to drive out of a skid.<br><br>There were a few ribs in this otherwise smooth existence, however, and these ribs would make all the difference for my lonely father, waiting for help in a seaside bar. Louis was a teetotaler, but his wife, Claudia, drank. Nobody knew it at first. She bought her booze at least one town away and hid the bottles in the closet of her youngest daughter&#x2019;s bedroom, the only closet no one would check. Mary had been born with a normal functioning mind, but her hips were askew and the doctors decided to operate when she was still an infant. One operation. Two operations. Each operation required an anesthetic, and the anesthetic may have curbed oxygen flow to the brain. By the time my mother was a teenager, Mary was in a wheelchair and in need of twenty-four-hour care.<br><br>When Claudia stopped vacuuming the house regularly and failed, on occasion, to fetch her children from school and activities, my mother didn&#x2019;t suspect alcohol at first. Claudia was masking clear liquors with Sprite and brown liquors with ginger ale. But one day my mother found the empty bottles in Mary&#x2019;s room, and she addressed the issue in the only way that made sense to her. She didn&#x2019;t stage an intervention. She staged a play. She pretended things were normal. Then she staged an insurrection. She made things normal. By the time she graduated from high school in 1968, caring for others came as instinctually as driving out of a skid.</p><h2>A Place Where Sunflowers Grow (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p><p>Under the harsh summer sun, Mari&#x2019;s art class has begun. But it&#x2019;s hard to think of anything to draw in a place where nothing beautiful grows &#x2014; especially a place like Topaz, the internment camp where Mari&#x2019;s family and thousands of other Japanese Americans have been sent to live during World War II. Somehow, glimmers of hope begin to surface &#x2014; in the eyes of a kindly art teacher, in the tender words of Mari&#x2019;s parents, and in the smile of a new friend. Amy Lee-Tai&#x2019;s sensitive prose and Felicia Hoshino&#x2019;s stunning mixed-media images show that hope can survive alongside even the harshest injustice.</p></p><p>Amy Lee-Tai was born in Queens, New York and is of Japanese and Chinese ancestry. She first learned of the internment from her mother and through her grandmother, Hisako Hibi&#x2019;s paintings. After earning her Master&#x2019;s in Education from Harvard, she worked in schools as a Reading Specialist. Amy now lives in Virginia with her husband and children. A Place Where Sunflowers Grow is her first book.Grade 1-4&#x2013;Lee-Tai based this story on the experiences of her grandparents and her mother, who were interned in Topaz, Utah, during World War II. With quiet understatement, the text focuses on the confusion and sadness young Mari feels after her familys abrupt relocation to the camp. In the harsh desert landscape, she thinks wistfully of her home, where she played with her brother in a yard filled with flowers. Her parents are worried about her silence and listlessness, but an art class offers her a means of expressing her feelings. She makes a friend as well, and when her desert sunflowers put up seedlings, she feels a new sense of hope. The story is told in both English and Japanese, and the earth-toned illustrations, created using watercolors, ink, tissue paper, and acrylic paint, nicely detail the simple plot. Hoshino modeled some of her compositions on those of Hisako Hibi, the authors grandmother and a prominent Japanese-American painter. Other picture books dealing with this topic include Eve Buntings <i>So Far from the Sea</i> (Clarion, 1998), Yoshiko Uchidas <i>The Bracelet</i> (Philomel, 1993), and Rick Noguchi and Deneen Jenkss <i>Flowers from Mariko</i> (Lee &amp; Low, 2001). Lee-Tais tale, with its emphasis on the internees dignity and feelings, offers the gentlest introduction to this tragic episode.<i>&#x2013;Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You can visit her at kirstenmillerbooks.com or follow @bankstirregular on Twitter.It was five minutes past midnight, and a boy was gazing down at Cypress Creek from the window of an old mansion on the town&#x2019;s highest hill. It was an odd-looking building. The front porch was overrun by a jungle of potted plants. Thick green vines crept up columns, and lady ferns and blood flowers fought for every patch of moonlight. An octagonal tower sprouted straight from the house&#x2019;s roof, and the entire structure was painted a dreadful shade of purple. Anyone who saw it might assume that the mansion&#x2019;s occupants were a bit on the strange side--and yet the boy at the window appeared perfectly normal. He had sandy blond hair and no visible tattoos, scars, or hideous warts. But judging by the miserable expression on his face, something was terribly wrong.<br><br>His name was Charlie Laird, and he&#x2019;d lived in Cypress Creek all twelve years of his life. He and his little brother, Jack, had grown up in a house just down the street. In fact, Charlie could see the old place from his new bedroom window. A different family of four owned it now. Every night, Charlie watched the lights in his former home go out and imagined the kids snuggled up nice and safe, tucked into bed by their mother and father. He would have given almost anything to trade places with them. It had been three months since he&#x2019;d moved to the purple mansion on DeChant Hill with his brother and father. And it had been three months since Charlie Laird had gotten a good night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>Charlie took a step back from the window and saw his reflection in the glass. His skin was the color of curdled milk, and dark bags sagged beneath his red-rimmed eyes. He sighed at the sight and turned around to start his night&#x2019;s work. Thirty-eight heavy boxes sat in the center of the room. They were filled with video games and comic books and Little League trophies. Charlie had unpacked nothing more than a few changes of clothes. The rest of his belongings were still stowed away in their cardboard boxes. And every night, before he lay down in his bed, he would move them. Nineteen boxes were used to block the door to the hall. The other nineteen were pushed against the bathroom door, though that often proved quite inconvenient.<br><br>It would have seemed ridiculous to anyone else. Even Charlie knew the barricades couldn&#x2019;t stop his bad dreams. But the witch who&#x2019;d been visiting him every night for three months wasn&#x2019;t like other nightmares he&#x2019;d had. Most dreams faded, but he couldn&#x2019;t forget her. She felt just as real as the nose on his face. So when the witch swore that one night soon she&#x2019;d come drag him away, Charlie figured he should take her threats seriously. He just hoped all the boxes could keep her out of his room.<br><br>She&#x2019;d already gotten as far as the hallway. The first time he&#x2019;d heard someone sneaking through the house, Charlie had just woken up from a nightmare. The sun&#x2019;s rays were peeking over the mountains, but the mansion was still and quiet. Suddenly the silence had been broken by the creak of rusty door hinges opening. Then the floorboards groaned and there were thuds on the stairs. The footsteps were heavy enough to be an adult&#x2019;s. But when Charlie worked up the nerve to investigate, he found his father and stepmother still asleep in their bed. A few nights later, he heard the same thing again. Creak. Groan. Thud. His father said that old houses make noises. His brother thought the place might be haunted. But Charlie knew there was no such thing as ghosts. He&#x2019;d been searching for almost three years, and if they&#x2019;d existed he would have seen one by now. No, Charlie Laird had far bigger problems than ghosts.<br>The thirty-eight boxes were waiting. Charlie stared at the daunting task in front of him and wondered where he&#x2019;d find the energy to complete it. His nightmares had gotten worse--and every night he fought a losing battle against sleep. Now his eyelids were drooping and he couldn&#x2019;t stop yawning. As usual, he&#x2019;d stood by the window until midnight, waiting for his father and stepmother to go to bed. He didn&#x2019;t want them to hear him sliding the boxes across the floorboards or grunting as he stacked them against the doors. But staying up was growing harder and harder. He&#x2019;d tried taping his eyes open, but Scotch tape was too weak and duct tape pulled out his eyebrows. Pacing just made him dizzy. And while he&#x2019;d heard that a full bladder could keep sleep at bay, every time he tried chugging water at bedtime, he ended up frantically shoving nineteen boxes away from the bathroom door. So a few weeks earlier, when all else had failed, Charlie had taken his first trip to the kitchen for a cup of cold, leftover coffee. It always made him gag, and sometimes he had to hold his nose just to get it all down--but the coffee was the only thing that kept him awake.<br>Charlie tiptoed to his bedroom door, opened it slowly so the hinges wouldn&#x2019;t squeal, and took a peek outside. He was relieved to see that the hallway was dark. He preferred it that way. The walls were lined with old paintings that were far creepier when the lights were on. He listened closely for signs of movement and then sock-skated awkwardly toward the stairs. Past his brother&#x2019;s room. And his father and stepmother&#x2019;s. He was almost outside the last door on the hall when he heard it--a high-pitched laugh that nearly sent him sprinting back to his bed. Behind the last door lay the stairs to the tower. And at the top of those stairs was a room known in the family as Charlotte&#x2019;s Lair. The door was open a crack, and Charlie heard the sound of a fat cat&#x2019;s paws padding down the wooden staircase. A pale golden light leaked out into the hall.<br><br>His stepmother was still awake.</p><h2>Luna Marine (The Heritage Trilogy, Book 2) (Heritage Trilogy, 2)</h2><p><p>The revelations on Mars -- a half-million year-old legacy of the vanished star-traveling Builders -- have fed the flames of catastrophic war.

A thriller of runaway tension, taps into our most closely guarded fears, taking us on a harrowing journey into a realm of terror and pain, of love gone wrong and vengeance gone mad.<b><br><br></b>Psychologist Alan Gregory is living through a season of discontent. With a new daughter, a wonderful wife, and a prospering career, he has little to complain about and lots of regrets: past cases that won&#x2019;t let him go, patients who don&#x2019;t get better, and a growing unease with keeping secrets. But Gregory has two new patients who will drag him out of his introspection&#x2014;and dare him to enter a storm of injustice and revenge. <br><br>FBI special agent Kelda James is a hero, a woman who as a rookie agent made a choice, drew her gun, and saved a life, taking another. Now Kelda is hiding from the world a secret pain that is gradually crippling her body&#x2014;and she has turned to Alan Gregory to help free her from the prison of her pain. Then Kelda refers a patient to Gregory, who is terrifyingly dangerous to them both.<br><br>Tom Clone served thirteen years on Colorado&#x2019;s death row for a crime he claimed he didn&#x2019;t commit&#x2014;until an FBI agent dug up evidence that set him free. The agent&#x2019;s name: Kelda James. With both Kelda and Clone telling him their innermost secrets, Alan Gregory becomes the one person who can piece together an extraordinary puzzle&#x2014;of two unsolved violent deaths of vulnerable women, of a man who may be innocent or may be very lucky, and of the strange, fatal attraction between two people trapped in a horrific plot to get revenge&#x2014;at any price.<br><br>A thriller that delivers a stunning body-blow of a surprise ending, captures lives colliding at unpredictable angles, probing the dangerous lies people tell to each other and themselves. In this astonishing work by a novelist at the height of his powers, Stephen White brilliantly blends thrilling action and breakneck pacing with unrivaled insight into the human mind, heart, and psyche.</p><p>Tom Clone's stay on death row is over, thanks to new evidence uncovered by Kelda James, a young FBI agent whose efforts on Clone's behalf have not exactly endeared her to her colleagues. Referred by that same agent to psychologist Alan Gregory, Clone is struggling to adapt to life outside prison. But others who believe he got off on a technicality don't agree that the former medical student deserves his freedom, and they will go to any lengths to make sure he's punished accordingly for the crime of which he was once accused. There are some surprising plot twists here, but more interesting is Gregory's midlife crisis and his declining interest in his work: as his partner responds when he voices doubts about his efficacy as a therapist, "Those are the bricks we lay. If you've started hating the bricks, maybe it's time to reconsider being a brick layer." Certainly Gregory gets himself into more sinister and frightening scrapes than most shrinks, and this is one of his strangest cases. <i>The Best Revenge</i> is a solid, well-reasoned thriller, set in the marvelously drawn Colorado landscape the author has made his own, with guest appearances by minor figures familiar to readers of this increasingly popular psychological suspense series. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Stephen White&#x2019;s thrillers are...<br><br>&#x201c;Shocking, leaving the reader breathless.&#x201d;<br>--<i>The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)<br><br></i>&#x201c;Psychological suspense at its best.&#x201d;<br>--Jeffery Deaver<br><br>&#x201c;Required reading for thriller fans.&#x201d;<br>--<i>The Miami Herald<br><br></i>&#x201c;Fascinating.

Though it has aged gracefully, the passing years nevertheless called for updated bibliographies, revisions, and new articles, culminating in the 1996 one-volume Supplement. Now, in the face of significant competition since the late 1990s, comes the second edition, which integrates most of the 1967 and 1996 material with hundreds of new articles, addenda to earlier articles, and updated bibliographies. Section editors were given the task of reviewing the earlier entries and deciding which could be retained, with perhaps only bibliographical updates, and which required addenda or completely new material.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Dinosaur Search (Great Searches)</h2><p>Usborne The Great Dinosaur Search</p><p></p><h2>The Pied Piper of Peru</h2><p>Boyds Mills Press publishes a wide range of high-quality fiction and nonfiction picture books, chapter books, novels, and nonfiction</p><p>Ages 5-7. Like Tompert's <i>Saint Nicholas</i> (2000), this book draws on an incident that reportedly happened, in this case to Saint Martin de Porres, who grew up in sixteenth-century Lima, Peru. For somewhat younger children than <i>Saint Nicholas</i>, this recounts only one story, rather than several. Juana the mouse lives a quiet life in the priory until a greedy new mouse alerts the Dominican brothers to the mouse colony. When a cat fails to rid the priory of rodents, Brother Martin is instructed to use traps. Fortunately, he finds a solution more fitting to God's plan. Lithuanian artist Kasparavicius fleshes out the rather thin story with realistic human figures and expertly detailed backgrounds of the priory garden and buildings. The problem comes with his depiction of the mice, which are sweetly decked out in little aprons--a rather odd juxtaposition to the otherwise lifelike pictures. Still, the gentle feel of the art fits the story, and kids will enjoy following the activities of the mice as they try to make a new home. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With its unprecedented precision and masterful use of color (down to the most minute details reflected in the background mirror), the painting is a testament to the mastery of Flemish painter <strong>Jan van Eyck</strong> (c. 1390-1441), leader of the Early Netherland School. Though he cannot be credited, as many have claimed, as the inventor of oil painting, his use of the medium was highly innovative, allowing for great intensity and depth of color.

He lives on a farm in northern Michigan.Best known for his fiction, Harrison here sorts magazine pieces written over four decades. "Food" celebrates the pleasures of cooking, eating and drinking, with exuberant disdain for trendy health-consciousness. "Travel and Sport" defends hunting and fishing as time-honored, ecologically sound pursuits that, practiced responsibly, draw us closer to the natural world. "Literary Matters" includes book reviews and dissections of the author's own working methods. Harrison, who came of professional age in the 1960s, favors a casual, intimate journalistic style that reveals as much about himself as his topics. We learn about the loss of an eye when he was seven and the deaths of his father and sister when he was 19. While a few phrases and stories turn up more than once, and while some of the early-'70s sporting pieces display a hip swagger that now seems hilariously dated, the essays taken together suggest the life experience and philosophy that underpin such novels as Legends of the Fall and Dalva. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Real Deal Comix</h2><p>Inspired by magazines like Mad and traditional superhero comics, Real Deal magazine was a self-published,independent comic book created in the 1990s by Lawrence Hubbard (a.k.a &#x201c;RawDog&#x201d;) and H.P.

As we witness the rise and bloody fall of the revolutionary animals, we begin to recognize the seeds of totalitarianism in the most idealistic organization; and in our most charismatic leaders, the souls of our cruelest oppressors.<br><br><b>With a foreword by Ann Patchett</b></p><p>Since its publication in 1946, George Orwell's fable of a workers' revolution gone wrong has rivaled Hemingway's <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> as the Shortest Serious Novel It's OK to Write a Book Report About. (The latter is three pages longer and less fun to read.) Fueled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism, <i>Animal Farm</i> is a nearly perfect piece of writing, both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars, and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed, or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. "We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples." While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. Satire <i>Animal Farm</i> may be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs. Orwell's view of Communism is bleak indeed, but given the history of the Russian people since 1917, his pessimism has an air of prophecy. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i>A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they embark on the creation of a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned -- a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published fifty years ago, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner; the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell&#39;s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.</p><h2>The RAVENS</h2><p>Drawing on materials that were, until recently, classified, this account depicts the intense air war fought over Laos and profiles the &#34;Ravens,&#34; the pilots who risked their lives in this little-known field of war</p><p>The Ravens were American forward air-controllers who directed strikes from vulnerable, low-flying spotter planes, mainly in support of a Meo general named Vang Pao in Laos. "Advised" by the CIA, this fierce warlord fought to keep the North Vietnamese out of the strategic Plain of Jars. Robbins (Air America) conveys the unique flavor of Raven-style combat and also explains how the diplomatic-military dynamics of the clandestine war in Laos fit into the overall American effort in Southeast Asia. The cast of characters is memorable: a swaggering, rowdy bunch of mavericks whom their parent service (the U.S. Air Force) had great difficulty controlling, they seemed to get by on sheer cussedness. According to the author, they suffered the highest casualty rate of the Indochinese War. Robbins describes the poignant plight of displaced Meo/Hmong tribespeople who have settled uneasily in the United Statesincluding General Paoand their ongoing struggle to "propitiate the alien spirits of America." Photos. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1961-75 the CIA ran a secret war in Laos, using Hmong tribesmen and covert U.S. Air Force air support. Ravens, USAF forward air controllers (FACs), flew low and slow over the battlefields, calling in air strikes on North Vietnamese soldiers. These men exposed themselves to every sort of risk. Robbins provides a detailed, readable account, with ample history and background to provide context. He is critical of U.S. military strategy and command, generally dismissive of extravagant claims against the CIA, and partial to the FACs. Likely to be popular with military buffs.

Whether you are a teacher, a student, or a parent, this book will help you understand what Darwin's theory of evolution is, why many scientists find it persuasive, and why other scientists question the theory or some key aspects of it.<p>Sometimes, scientists find that the same evidence can be explained in more than one way. When there are competing theories, reasonable people can (and do) disagree about which theory best explains the evidence. Furthermore, in the historical sciences, neither side can directly verify its claims about past events. Fortunately, even though we can't directly verify these claims, we can test them. How? First, we gather as much evidence as possible and look at it carefully. Then, we compare the competing theories in light of how well they explain the evidence.</p><p>Looking at the evidence and comparing the competing explanations will provide the most reliable path to discovering which theory, if any, gives the best account of the evidence at hand. In science, it is ultimately the evidence-and all of the evidence-that should tell us which theory offers the best explanation. This book will help you explore that evidence, and we hope it will stimulate your interest in these questions as you weigh the competing arguments.</p><p></p></p><p>Two microbiologists, two philosophers of science and a technical writer present for students a concise introduction to the cases, both pro and con, regarding major aspects of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.<p>Within the evolutionary-biology realm, the authors explore how Darwin's theories of natural selection and universal common descent are faring these days. They use an inquiry-based approach: point, counterpoint. The book's brevity precludes extended treatment of topics, but through succinct language and extensive use of illustrated sidebars and summary boxes, an impressive amount of terrain is covered in a colorful and lively fashion. The role of the fossil record, biogeography and anatomical, molecular and embryonic similarities are rolled out to buttress the theory of universal common descent. Counterclaims follow that seek to undermine the earlier conclusions, including the circular reasoning of the molecular clock, the potential fabrications of Haeckel's ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, how differing family trees are created via anatomical and molecular patterns of relationships and the meaning of gaps in fossil evidence. They move on to probe how the evidence squares with theories of variation, heritability and differential reproduction; that is, the creative power of natural selection. Challenges to examples of artificial selection and microevolution namely, the beak of the finch and the peppered moth classics take them apart without necessarily dismissing the theories writ large. The same can be said for natural selection as a whole, from disagreements that impugn the validity of co-option in forming complex organisms, or the importance of mutation in producing fundamentally new life forms. Still, in the end, it is Darwinism that raises the interesting questions, which is what good science is all about. </p><p> Substantive food for thought about natural selection and universal common descent, and surprisingly rich for so concise a treatment.</p><p> --Kirkus Reviews</p></p><h2>Blood Trail</h2><p>In the wake of an elk hunter&#39;s grisly murder, Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett is directed by the governor to investigate the relevance of a mysterious poker chip found at the crime scene.

L.B. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Mothman Prophecies</h2><p>This non-fiction account of aliens invading a town in West Virginia - first published in 1975 - has now been made into a major motion picture starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Alan Bates. It will be one of the biggest movies of 2002, opening in the USA in January, followed by world-wide release. A big UK opening is now tentatively set for early March. For thirteen months the entire town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic &#34;Bird&#34; - the Mothman.</p><p>John A. Keel is a noted Fortean investigator. He spent a year in Point Pleasant where he saw and experienced many of the strange manifestations personally.1:<br>Beelzebub Visits West Virginia <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fingers of lightning tore holes in the black skies as an angry cloudburst drenched the surrealistic landscape. It was 3 A.M. on a cold, wet morning in late November 1967, and the little houses scattered along the dirt road winding through the hills of West Virginia were all dark. Some seemed unoccupied and in the final stages of decay. Others were un-painted, neglected, forlorn. The whole setting was like the opening scene of a Grade B horror film from the 1930s.<br>Along the road there came a stranger in a land where strangers were rare and suspect. He walked up to the door of a crumbling farmhouse and hammered. After a long moment a light blinked on somewhere in the house and a young woman appeared, drawing a cheap mail-order bathrobe tightly about her. She opened the door a crack and her sleep-swollen face winced with fear as she stared at the apparition on her doorstep. He was over six feet tall and dressed entirely in black. He wore a black suit, black tie, black hat, and black overcoat, with impractical black dress shoes covered with mud. His face, barely visible in the darkness, sported a neatly trimmed mustache and goatee. The flashes of lightning behind him added an eerie effect.<br>"May I use your phone?" He asked in a deep baritone, his voice lacking the familiar West Virginia accent. The girl gulped silently and backed away.<br>"My husband..." She mumbled. 'Talk to my husband."<br>She closed the door quickly and backed away into the darkness. Minutes passed. Then she returned accompanied by a rugged young man hastily buckling his trousers in place. He, too, turned pale at the sight of the stranger.<br>"We ain't got a phone here," he grunted through the crack in the door just before he slammed it.

UP.</p><p>Cultural historian Peter Gay (<i>The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud</i>, <i>Freud: A Life for Our Time</i>) applies his considerable analytic skills to his memoir of his early years as a Jew in 1930s Berlin. Light-haired, blue-eyed, and culturally assimilated, the Frohlich family, as they were then known, convinced themselves that, despite the growth spurt of the Nazi party, anti-Semitism was on the wane among the German populous. Gay recalls that his daily life was relatively unaffected by the Totalitarian regime. That is until 1933, when, according to law, he became a Jew overnight. Soon the family found their living quarters shrinking and their awareness of their plight growing (though no one could possibly conceive of what would come). Though still a boy, Gay remembers that "one of the greatest moments in my life" came when the German women's relay team dropped their baton at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Then came Kristallnacht, which crystallized the family's sublimated fears and precipitated their flight from their home. After a certain suspenseful series of necessary deceits and circuitous travels, the family began their new life in America--12-year-old Peter spoke barely a word of English. Now, decades later, Gay employs his new native tongue to uncover the psychological impulses that fed his parents' decision to stay in Berlin as long as they did and governed his own behavior as a boy. The result is credible answer to the question: How could they have stayed?<b>Peter Gay</b> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University and director of the Center for Scholars and Writers, New York Public Library.

This book attempts to illuminate every circumstance, internal and external, emotional and technical, involved in the arduous process that culminates in what we see on the big screen. Only the director knows the background to the scenes, behind every passing frame of film, and the complex series of details and decisions involved, from budget considerations to divine inspiration, from the earliest rehearsal to the final screening. Sidney Lumet&#39;s knowledge of the art and craft of directing is considerable, and here he discusses everything from art direction and wardrobe, shooting and editing, the verbal and mechanical soundtracks, to the distribution and marketing of a film and the role of the studio.</p><p></p><h2>Key West Color</h2><p>Award-winning photographer Alan S. Maltz has captured the spirit of the Island City, from the solitude and serenity of bone-fishing to the inundation of sights and sounds at the annual Fantasy Fest Parade. Voted &#34;Best Coffee Table Book of the Year&#34; by the National Association of Independent Publishers. 235 color images.</p><p>Big price, but big book--a <i>gorgeous</i> one, in fact. Maltz's album of color photos of Key West aren't somber, sensitive mood shots, but bright, sprightly celebrations of tropical existence. This outr{&#x201a;}e place, this island called Key West, possesses a legendary status that is way beyond its small circumference; it's a place where life isn't cheap but is certainly unbridled. Maltz trains his experienced eye on the flora, fauna, architecture, and other physical attributes of this Caribbean locale, but equally arresting are his shots of the people who live there or come to play--and anyone who's been to Key West knows that the fascinating characters who congregate there contribute as much to the allure of the island as its beauty. One photograph, of men in drag parading down Duval Street, is entitled "Self Expression." That about sums up what goes on in Key West. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East, Vol. 4</h2><p>Book by Spalding, Baird T.</p><p>Baird T.

Powers has written a novel that includes all the ferocity, complexity, and racial violence of the American South" --- Philipp Meyer, author of <i>American Rust</i></b><br>Spanning over one hundred years, from the antebellum era to the 1980's, A Shout in the Ruins examines the fates of the inhabitants of Beauvais Plantation outside of Richmond, Virginia. When war arrives, the master of Beauvais, Anthony Levallios, foresees that dominion in a new America will be measured not in acres of tobacco under cultivation by his slaves, but in industry and capital. A grievously wounded Confederate veteran loses his grip on a world he no longer understands, and his daughter finds herself married to Levallois, an arrangement that feels little better than imprisonment. And two people enslaved at Beauvais plantation, Nurse and Rawls, overcome impossible odds to be together, only to find that the promise of coming freedom may not be something they will live to see.<br><br>Seamlessly interwoven is the story of George Seldom, a man orphaned by the storm of the Civil War, looking back from the 1950s on the void where his childhood ought to have been. Watching the government destroy his neighborhood to build a stretch of interstate highway through Richmond, he travels south in an attempt to recover his true origins. With the help of a young woman named Lottie, he goes in search of the place he once called home, all the while reckoning with the more than 90 years he lived as witness to so much that changed during the 20th century, and so much that didn't. As we then watch Lottie grapple with life's disappointments and joys in the 1980's, now in her own middle-age, the questions remain: How do we live in a world built on the suffering of others? And can love exist in a place where for 400 years violence has been the strongest form of intimacy?<br><br>Written with the same emotional intensity, harrowing realism, and poetic precision that made THE YELLOW BIRDS one of the most celebrated novels of the past decade, A SHOUT IN THE RUINS cements Powers' place in the forefront of American letters and demands that we reckon with the moral weight of our troubling history.<br><br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2018:</strong> Kevin Powers&#x2019; 2012 debut <em>The Yellow Birds</em> was a compact novel based loosely on his experiences as a soldier in Iraq, and it put him on a short list of talented new writers to watch. In this sophomore effort, <em>A Shout in the Ruins</em>, Powers has written another compact work, albeit one that introduces more characters and spans over 100 years. It opens during the Civil War, on the Beauvais Plantation outside of Richmond and examines the fates of those living on the plantation, white and black, through roughly a century. The south has a history built on violence and displacement, as does the country as a whole, and Powers is asking what that means for us, the people who have inherited that history. With its scope, themes, and careful attention to language, <em>A Shout in the Ruins</em> is a highly ambitious novel. You read the book as much to get lost in the words, in the voice and richness of description, as you do for the story; and while it may not hit every mark, it succeeds in its attempt to reach farther and higher than most. &#x2013; <em>Chris Schluep</em>Kevin Powers is the author of <em>The Yellow Birds</em>, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award, the Guardian First Book Award, and was a National Book Award Finalist, as well as <i>Letter Composed During a Lull in the Fighting</i>, a collection of poetry.

Sometimes their fights lasted for hours. They always ended with a door slamming, and then her father would come up to see her in her bedroom and tell her everything was fine.<br><br>They had been arguing for an hour this time, and Alex could hear her mother screaming. She had a hot Latin temper, and Alex could remember her parents&#x2019; arguments for as long as she&#x2019;d been alive. They had gotten worse in the last year or two, and afterward her mother would be gone for a few days, or a few weeks sometimes, and everything would be quiet for a while when she came back. And then it would start again, like tonight. Her mother had said at dinner that she wanted to go to Miami for a few days to see friends, her father had reminded her unhappily that she&#x2019;d just been there, and then they sent Alex upstairs. Her mother didn&#x2019;t care who heard them fight, but her father always sent Alex to her room. She put her pillows over her head as she tried not to listen, but you could hear them all over the house. They lived in a residential neighborhood of Boston, and sometimes Alex&#x2019;s friends next door said they could hear them too. Her mother did most of the shouting, and threw things sometimes, while Alex&#x2019;s father tried to calm her down before she broke something or one of the neighbors called the police. That hadn&#x2019;t happened yet, but he was afraid that one day it might.<br><br>Carmen Cortez and Eric Winslow had met in Miami when he was there on a business trip. He was the head of a construction firm that built office buildings and specialized in banks. He was there for a job they were bidding on, and had gone to dinner alone at a lively restaurant on the first night of his trip. He had seen a group of attractive young people walk in, and heard them speaking Spanish when they sat down at a table next to his, and a spectacular looking young woman had instantly caught his eye. Sensing him watching her, she had glanced over and smiled at him. He was a goner after that.<br><br>Eric was a sensible man with a quiet life. He had been married to a college professor who had died of breast cancer two years before, after putting up a noble fight. They had no children, and had made a conscious decision not to have any, due to health problems his wife had had all her life. They had never been unhappy about their decision, and accepted it as a reasonable choice for them.<br><br>He had done well at his job over the years, Barbara enjoyed her work teaching American history at Boston University, and they loved their home, which felt too large for him without her. He had expected them to spend their golden years together and hadn&#x2019;t anticipated being widowed at forty-�eight. That hadn&#x2019;t been in their plan, and once she was gone, he felt like a marble in a shoebox, rolling around, lost at home, as he sat alone reading in his den every night. Everything seemed so meaningless without her. He traveled for business frequently, but there was no one to come home to, no one to tell about the projects he was working on, and he had thought this trip to Miami would be no different. The silence in the house would be deafening when he got back. Their housekeeper, Elena, still came in several times a week and prepared meals she left for him in the freezer, and he put them in the microwave when he got home from work. He had no family, no siblings, no children, and he felt like a fifth wheel now with their friends, and spent most of his nights and weekends alone. His only pleasure and distraction were the crime thrillers he loved to read. He had a bookcase full of them.<br><br>He was surprised when a live salsa band started playing at the restaurant during dinner the night he met Carmen, and even more so when she got up and invited him to dance. She was wearing a short, low-�cut red dress that clung to her perfect body, and she told him that she was a model and occasional actress. She had come from Cuba at eighteen four years before. They danced for a few minutes, and then with a warm smile she went back to her friends. He had no idea what had gotten into him when he agreed to dance with her, it was unlike him, but she was so dazzling that when she walked over to him, he couldn&#x2019;t decline. She concentrated on her friends after that, and he noticed that they laughed a lot, and he felt faintly ridiculous, but he gave her his business card when he left the restaurant, and told her where he was staying in Miami. He was certain that a woman as vivacious and young as Carmen would never call him.<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever come to Boston . . .&#x201d; he said, thinking of how foolish he sounded. He was twenty-�eight years older than she was, more than twice her age. He realized full well how old he must seem to her and her friends, but he had never met another woman as exciting in his life. She had black hair and green eyes, light olive skin, a tan, and a flawless body. He thought of her all night, and was stunned when she called him at the hotel the next morning, before he left for a meeting. He invited her to dinner, and she told him where to meet her, and he was obsessed with images of her all day.<br><br>She looked fabulous when he saw her at the restaurant, wearing a short black dress and high heels. They went dancing after dinner, and then to a bar she suggested, and they talked until four a.m. He was fascinated by her. She explained to him that she was a trade show model, and had dreams of going to L.A. or New York for a big acting career. And in the meantime, since arriving from Havana, she had worked as a waitress, a model, a bartender, and a disco dancer to make ends meet. She spoke excellent English, with an accent, and he thought she was the most beautiful girl he&#x2019;d ever seen. He was leaving for Boston the next day, but he said if his firm got the Miami project, he&#x2019;d be back in town frequently. In the end, he returned to Miami two weeks later, just to see her. They had a fantastic weekend, and within a month, he was head over heels in love, and totally besotted with her. It seemed foolish at his age, but he didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Eric took Carmen to restaurants she had heard of but never been to, and they went for long walks on the beach. And on the second weekend he came to visit her, she stayed at his hotel with him. Eric was a handsome man, with a trim, athletic physique, and she said she wasn&#x2019;t bothered by his age. He was aware of her financial struggles and offered to help her, but she always thanked him and declined. His firm didn&#x2019;t get the project that they&#x2019;d bid on in Miami, but three months after they started dating, in a moment of impulsive madness totally uncharacteristic of him, Eric asked Carmen to marry him. And she accepted.<br><br>They were married by a justice of the peace in Miami. Although her mother couldn&#x2019;t leave Havana, a handful of Carmen&#x2019;s friends were present, and he had arranged for a wedding dinner at the Fontainebleau Hotel, which Carmen loved. At the end of the weekend, Carmen took her three suitcases full of everything she owned and flew to Boston with him for the first time. When they arrived, he carried his exotic bride over the threshold into a world that was totally unfamiliar to her. Her first months were acute culture shock. The weather was cold and gray, and it snowed frequently, which she hated. She was cold all the time, bored while he was at work, and missed her friends. He took her to Miami after a few months to see her pals. They were all envious of her comfortable new life, although dubious about his age. And six months after they were married, Eric and Carmen were both surprised when they discovered she was pregnant. It was an accident, but after careful thought, Eric felt it was a fortuitous one. Having children had never been an option with Barbara&#x2019;s health, but now the idea of a baby delighted him, and he hoped it would be a son to carry on his name. He would teach him to play baseball since he was an avid sports fan, and take him to games. He might even coach him in Little League. He thought a baby would help to bond Carmen to him, since she still felt out of place in his conservative Boston world and had no friends of her own there. She didn&#x2019;t like his friends and found them boring, so they spent their time with each other.<br><br>Carmen was considerably less excited about the baby than he was, and didn&#x2019;t feel ready for motherhood at twenty-�two. It would shelve her modeling career for a year, although she hadn&#x2019;t been able to get work in Boston, and she had nothing to do all day. Eventually she watched Spanish soap operas on TV until Eric got home from work, and waited for the baby to arrive. It was due in February. And having convinced each other it was a boy, they decorated the nursery in blue. Eric could hardly contain himself he was so excited, and bought a box of cigars to hand out on the big day.<br><br>Alexandra was born on the night of a blizzard in Boston. The delivery was worse than anything Carmen had imagined, and than he had feared. The doctor said it was normal for a first labor to be lengthy, and for the delivery to be as rough as it was. Carmen didn&#x2019;t even want to see the baby once it was born. Eric had been in the delivery room with her, and there was a shocked silence when the doctor announced that it was a girl. It took Eric several hours to get over his disappointment, but once he held her, he fell in love with his daughter. Carmen was heavily sedated and asleep by then, and she didn&#x2019;t adjust to the baby as easily as he did. Their housekeeper, Elena, took care of Alexandra when they got home, and all Carmen could talk about was getting her figure back and going to Miami to see her friends. She hadn&#x2019;t been in months, since Eric didn&#x2019;t want her traveling in the last stages of the pregnancy.<br><br>Going to a local gym every day and dieting, and as young as she was, Carmen got her figure back quickly, and when Alexandra was three months old, Carmen went to Miami for three days and stayed two weeks, partying with her friends. But she was in much better spirits when she got back. Eric and Elena took care of the baby whle she was away.<br><br>She made regular trips to Florida every month after that, even worked a couple of trade shows while she was there, and left the baby with Eric. She still had no friends in Boston, and their life was too boring and traditional for her. It became rapidly obvious to him that motherhood wasn&#x2019;t Carmen&#x2019;s strong suit. All she wanted was to be in Miami with her friends. And when Alex was a year old, Eric discovered that Carmen was having an affair with a male dancer in Miami. He was from Puerto Rico, and she was tearful about it when she confessed and promised it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again.<br><br>She had several slips in spite of that and committed numerous indiscretions over the years. She was lonely in Boston, she thought Eric&#x2019;s life was tedious and dull, and so was he. Despite Carmen&#x2019;s behavior, he did everything possible to keep the marriage together, for the child&#x2019;s sake as well as his. He was still very taken with his wife in the early years, until it finally dawned on him when Alex was three years old that Carmen was never going to settle down and didn&#x2019;t love him. She might stay with him for practical reasons, and the perks of his lifestyle, but she wasn&#x2019;t in love with him. Eric&#x2019;s worst fear was that she would take the child and leave him, and he didn&#x2019;t want to lose Alex, or even share custody. He knew that if Carmen left him and took Alex to Miami, it would be an unsavory life for the little girl, among Carmen&#x2019;s loosely behaved friends. Alex was his daughter and he wanted her to live a wholesome, traditional life, not the haphazard, dubious one her mother engaged in as soon as she went back to her old familiar world.<br><br>The only way Eric managed to keep the marriage together was by letting Carmen do what she wanted, come and go as she pleased, and he turned a blind eye to her affairs, although he could always tell when there was a new man in her life. She spent all her time on the phone, smiling happily when she got calls from him.</p><h2>Down Home Ways</h2><p>A storehouse of directions and recipes for hundreds of projects, this catalog contains instructions for making useful and economical products such as homemade shampoo, cough medicine, cosmetics, rugs, hammocks, and corncob pipes</p><p></p><h2>Shane</h2><p>CALL ME SHANE: He rode into our valley in the summer of 89, a slim man , dressed in black. &#34;Call me Shane&#34; he said , he never told us more...</p><p>6 1-hour cassettes"<i>Call Me Shane</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<br>He rode into our valley in the summer of '89, a slim man, dresses inblack.<br>"Call me Shane," he said.

Alan Taylor, CIA chief in Istanbul, sentimental nihilist and professional malcontent, enlists nervy, vulnerable Anna Barnes, fresh from Harvard's department of Ottoman history, on a mission to destabilize Moslem-dominated Soviet Central Asia. Together they recruit a crude, burned-out ex-CIA man in Athens, an Armenian dissident intellectual and an Uzbek ex-Nazi agent who has been living among Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn.

Perhaps more than any other single author, his writings have constituted the most compelling evidence available for recognizing Jacques Lacan as the preemient philosopher of our time.<br><br>In <i>Tarrying with the Negative</i>, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek challenges the contemporary critique of ideology, and in doing so opens the way for a new understanding of social conflict, particularly the recent outbursts of nationalism and ethnic struggle. Are we, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek asks, confined to a postmodern universe in which truth is reduced to the contingent effect of various discursive practices and where our subjectivity is dispersed through a multitude of ideological positions? <i>No</i> is his answer, and the way out is a return to philosophy. This revisit to German Idealism allows &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek to recast the critique of ideology as a tool for disclosing the dynamic of our society, a crucial aspect of which is the debate over nationalism, particularly as it has developed in the Balkans&#x2014;&#x17d;i&#x17e;ek's home. He brings the debate over nationalism into the sphere of contemporary cultural politics, breaking the impasse centered on nationalisms simultaneously fascistic and anticolonial aspirations. Provocatively, &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek argues that what drives nationalistic and ethnic antagonism is a collectively driven refusal of our own enjoyment.<br><br>Using examples from popular culture and high theory to illuminate each other&#x2014;opera, film noir, capitalist universalism, religious and ethnic fundamentalism&#x2014;this work testifies to the fact that, far more radically than the postmodern sophists, Kant and Hegel are our contemporaries.</p><p>&#34;This new Zizek is as stunning as its predecessors, and breaks new philosophical ground.

Our notion of the self, intimately dependent as it is on our response to the excretions and secretions of our bodies, depends on it. Cultural identities have frequent recourse to its boundary-policing powers. Love depends on overcoming it, while the pleasure of sex comes in large measure from the titillating violation of disgust prohibitions. Imagine aesthetics without disgust for tastelessness and vulgarity; imagine morality without disgust for evil, hypocrisy, stupidity, and cruelty. </p><p> Miller details our anxious relation to basic life processes: eating, excreting, fornicating, decaying, and dying. But disgust pushes beyond the flesh to vivify the larger social order with the idiom it commandeers from the sights, smells, tastes, feels, and sounds of fleshly physicality. Disgust and contempt, Miller argues, play crucial political roles in creating and maintaining social hierarchy. Democracy depends less on respect for persons than on an equal distribution of contempt. Disgust, however, signals dangerous division. The high's belief that the low actually smell bad, or are sources of pollution, seriously threatens democracy. </p><p> Miller argues that disgust is deeply grounded in our ambivalence to life: it distresses us that the fair is so fragile, so easily reduced to foulness, and that the foul may seem more than passing fair in certain slants of light. When we are disgusted, we are attempting to set bounds, to keep chaos at bay. Of course we fail. But, as Miller points out, our failure is hardly an occasion for despair, for disgust also helps to animate the world, and to make it a dangerous, magical, and exciting place. </p></p><p>The title of William Ian Miller's book is a play on Robert Burton's 17th-century classic <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy,</i> an examination of human emotion. In his modern <i>Anatomy</i>, Miller narrows the focus to the function of disgust in human life. Disgust, Miller posits, is a kind of protection; just as fear causes us to flee danger or loyalty prompts us to support one another, disgust draws boundaries and insulates the individual from outside incursions--anything from the unhygienic hair in our soup to the frightening explosion of homelessness in our cities. Among his theories is one that democracy depends on the even distribution of disgust across class lines. <p> Mr. Miller is not afraid to explore the darker side of disgust as well--the fact that we may feel it in conjunction with contempt toward people, objects, or concepts that do not warrant it. Nevertheless, disgust serves an important role in humanity's complex emotional and social makeup, and <i>The Anatomy of Disgust</i> is novel in its approach to uncovering just what that role might be.</p>William Miller details our anxious relation to basic life processes; eating, excreting, fornicating, decaying, and dying.

Although many Westerners might say no, there are also many critically minded individuals who entertain what John Polkinghorne calls a "wistful wariness" toward religion--they feel unable to accept religion on rational grounds yet cannot dismiss it completely. Polkinghorne, both a particle physicist and Anglican priest, here explores just what rational grounds there could be for Christian beliefs, maintaining that the quest for motivated understanding is a concern shared by scientists and religious thinkers alike. Anyone who assumes that religion is based on unquestioning certainties, or that it need not take into account empirical knowledge, will be challenged by Polkinghorne's bottom-up examination of Christian beliefs about events ranging from creation to the resurrection.</p><p>The author organizes his inquiry around the Nicene Creed, an early statement that continues to summarize Christian beliefs. He applies to each of its tenets the question, "What is the evidence that makes you think this might be true?" The evidence Polkinghorne weighs includes the Hebrew and Christian scriptures--their historical contexts and the possible motivations for their having been written--scientific theories, and human self-consciousness as revealed in literary, philosophical, and psychological works.</p><p>He begins with the words, "We believe," and presents understandings of the nature of humanity, showing, for example, that Cartesian theory, evolution, and natural selection do not tell the <i>entire</i> story of what humans are about, especially in light of many sources that attest to our spirituality. Moving through the Creed, Polkinghorne considers the concept of divinity and God as creator in discussions that cover the Theory of Everything, the Big Bang Theory, and the possibility of divine presence within reality so that God is not simply an outside observer. Chapters on Jesus analyze the different ways events are described in the Gospels and the way motivation for belief is conveyed--for example, how do these writings explain why a young man killed in public disgrace could inspire a following, when other major world religious leaders lived to become highly revered elders in their communities?</p><p>"Faith seeking understanding" is, according to Polkinghorne, like the scientific quest. Both are journeys of intellectual discovery in which those who survey experience from an initially chosen point of view must be open to correction in the light of further experience. "Religion," he writes, "has long known that ultimately every human image of God proves to be an inadequate idol." <i>The Faith of a Physicist,</i> based on the prestigious 1993 Gifford Lectures, delivers a powerful message to scientists and theologians, theists and atheists alike.</p><p>Originally published in 1994.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The Massacre of Glencoe happened at 5am on 13th February 1692 when thirty-eight members of the Macdonald clan were killed by soldiers who had enjoyed the clan&#39;s hospitality for the previous ten days. Many more died from exposure in the mountains. Fifty miles to the south Corrag is condemned for her involvement in the Massacre. She is imprisoned, accused of witchcraft and murder, and awaits her death. The era of witch-hunts is coming to an end - but Charles Leslie, an Irish propagandist and Jacobite, hears of the Massacre and, keen to publicise it, comes to the tollbooth to question her on the events of that night, and the weeks preceding it. Leslie seeks any information that will condemn the Protestant King William, rumoured to be involved in the massacre, and reinstate the Catholic James. Corrag agrees to talk to him so that the truth may be known about her involvement, and so that she may be less alone, in her final days. As she tells her story, Leslie questions his own beliefs and purpose - and a friendship develops between them that alters both their lives. In Corrag, Susan Fletcher tells us the story of an epic historic event, of the difference a single heart can make - and how deep and lasting relationships that can come from the most unlikely places.</p><p>Susan Fletcher was born in 1979 in Birmingham. She is the author of the bestselling Eve Green and Oystercatchers.The plight of an accused witch in late 17th-century Britain inspires confusion, then pity, in her only visitor in Fletcher's engrossing historical (after Oystercatchers). The only witness to the massacre of the MacDonald clan, Corrag sits in a village jail under a death sentence for her supposed supernatural involvement in the killings. Her interrogator is Charles Leslie, a Catholic loyalist traveling in disguise who is seeking information that may implicate the Protestant king William in the murders. Corrag leads Charles through her lonely childhood: her mother hanged for witchcraft, Corrag fled her hometown and lived hand to mouth before gaining the protection of the MacDonald clan. Corrag spins colorful if sometimes meandering tales of the unfriendly English countryside and the fleeting joy of having found, in the clan, a place where she can be accepted; Charles is harder to pin down, and he often functions as a placeholder until his abrupt shift into a pivotal role late in the book. Fletcher gives readers a strong plot, enough vivid passages to compensate for the occasional dull spot, and a triumphant heroine in Corrag, whose travails are truly epic. (Nov.)

Today, Dr. Martens is a brand famous the world over, as iconic as Ray Bans and Levis. From the launch of the classic cherry-red eight-holer on that day in 1960, to the more recent multihued twenty-holers, Docs have been in the vanguard of style and culture for over four decades&#x2014;subversive, strident, authority-baiting. Now, for the first time, the boots and their times take center stage in a book. Decade by decade, in words and pictures,<i> Dr. Martens: The Story of an Icon</i> recounts the fascinating story of the music, the people, and the places that breathed life into the boot on its journey from work-wear to in-wear.</p><p>Described by the NME as &#34;the biographer of youth culture and music&#34; and by Record Collector as &#34;a publishing prodigy&#34;, Martin Roach has written 82 books in ten years, amassing over 2 million global book sales. Martin has a degree in historical research from Warwick University and now lives in rural Essex with his family.Music and pop culture journalist Roach (This Is It: The First Biography of the Strokes) presents a cheeky tribute to a famous shoe in this brash, colorful volume. Roach chronicles how Dr. Martens evolved from the working man's footwear of choice to punk icon supreme, using chatty prose and gritty photos of the shoes and the people who wear them. The current form of the shoe was born in 1960, although German prototypes existed earlier. An unassuming ad in a footwear industry magazine kicked things off, and, as Roach shows, Docs quickly assumed a key position in youth pop culture. Roach's account is humorous and doesn't take itself too seriously; his book is a melange of fashion, music and general cultural history. Although some bits of the book are only tangentially related to Dr. Martens-e.g., Jimi Hendrix's quote about acting crazy or Freddie Mercury's thoughts on rock stardom-everything ties together thematically, making this an interesting analysis of not only an item of clothing but of music subcultures, as well. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Magritte's paintings offer a space for the viewer to contemplate the emptiness of signs and to locate that emptiness in a world we recognize--indeed, the artist relies on the props of normalcy in order to upend, invert and collapse them into the terra incognita where life leaves off and art begins. "The mind loves the unknown," he avowed, "it loves images whose meaning is unknown, since the meaning of the mind itself is unknown." In <i>Attempting the Impossible</i> we have a new definitive Magritte monograph, replacing David Sylvester's volume of the early 1990s. Featuring more than 300 works, it contains much unpublished material and includes chapters covering Magritte's photography, drawings and influence on German and American contemporary art. Each chapter opens with a close reading of a key work--such as "The Treachery of Images" ("This is not a pipe") of 1928-29--and a reconstruction of its intellectual and historical contexts. Art historian Siegfried Gohr examines Magritte's marriage and friendships, the phases of his work (from his sunlit Renoir period and his <i>"p�riode vache</i>" to his bright and visually arresting postwar work, which had such an influence on the advertising industry), the Belgian roots of his wit and sensibility and his word paintings and investigations into the paradoxes of representation.</p><p>"The Bauhaus, that noble experiment in Germany between the world wars that in many ways ushered us into the modern world... This exhibit isn't like most art shows its like entering a whole world everywhere you turn you're struck by a dizzying array of paintings and sculpture, films and photographs... And the illuminating and thoroughly detailed catalogue, it weighs five pounds, gives you a pretty substantial impression of how profoundly prescient those artists were." --NPR, Loyd Shwartz<br><br>"This extremely well-illustrated tour de force combines new research with unique organization... Gohr's book reminds readers that excellent art never ceases to provide new avenues for investigation, through both research and careful visual examination of the art as primary document.

In 1983, Harold and Sandra were visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when they came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image provided the inspiration for ""Good Dog, Carl,"" which successfully began what would become an increasingly popular picture book series. The Darling's own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the first book's main character. Since then, three other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels.

Piers Anthony lives in Inverness, Florida.1 GLOHA Gloha flapped her feather wings until she was high above the harpy hutch. The Land of Xanth spread obligingly out below her, so that she could see all the way to its medium-far corners. There was Lake Ogre-Chobee, with its ogre tribe on the shore and its toothy reptilian swimmers. There was the great Gap Chasm with its horrendous six-legged Gap Dragon. There was all the monster-infested jungle between them. She loved all of it. But she couldn&#x2019;t pause to appreciate the sights. She had important business. She had to go see the Good Magician so she could ask him a Question. With luck and a year&#x2019;s Service, she might have his Answer. Then maybe she would have her heaving little heart&#x2019;s desire. She leveled off and flew swiftly toward the Good Magician&#x2019;s castle. She knew exactly where it was, but had never thought she would one day have to go there. That was because she had just somehow assumed that her life would work out well on its own, after the frustrations of childhood&nbsp;worked their way out of her system the moment she turned eighteen and became party to the Adult Conspiracy. Unfortunately, when she actually became party, she realized that she needed a male of her kind&#x2014;and she knew of none. She was the only person of her new species in Xanth. That had become a problem. So now she was off to the Good Magician Humfrey, and after doing her year of Service for his Answer, she would be able to settle down with the man of her dreams and live happily forever and ever after and torment their children unmercifully by not letting them know the secret of stork summoning. She was nineteen years old now, and would be twenty then, which would still leave her a faint bit of her youth for her true love to appreciate before they both became adult dullards the following year. She was not so vain as to assume that she would be different from all the other adults who had ever existed. It was too bad that life had to consist of the two problems of childhood and adulthood, with only that brief window of romance wedged in between, but that was the way it was. She knew; she had observed. She was mostly humanoid, and that was the way humanoids were. She reached the region of the castle, and paused in her flight. There was a mean-looking vapor hovering over it. That looked uncomfortably like Cumulo Fracto Nimbus, the worst of clouds. But what would he be doing here? He wouldn&#x2019;t dare harass the Good Magician. Reassured by that thought, she resumed flight. But the closer she got, the larger the cloud loomed, and the uglier it looked. Soon she realized that this wasn&#x2019;t merely the magic of perspective, that changed things according to their distance; that cloud was looming uglier on purpose. It&nbsp; <i>was</i>&nbsp;Fracto! She flew lower, to pass under the mean-spirited blob. But Fracto extended his vapors downward to intercept her. She tried to go around, but he sent boiling fog out to the sides&nbsp;to cut her off. His big amorphous mouth formed a gassy O. HO HO HO! it gusted. This was a real nuisance. Gloha had never liked Fracto, and this encounter was making her emotion ripen into active detestation. Of all times for the blowhard to be in her way! He must know where she was headed, so was getting his flatulent jollies from interfering with her. Somehow he always seemed to know when something important was happening, like a picnic, and he always came to spoil it. How was she going to get through to the Good Magician&#x2019;s castle? She realized now that the evil cloud would stay here as long as she did, just so he could ruin her mission. She hovered in the air, and waved her fine little fist at the big ugly cloud. &#x201c;Oh, you make me so angry, I could utter a bad word!&#x201d; she exclaimed. HO HO HO! A twisty gust reached out to blow her skirt up over her head so that way too much of her lithe little legs was exposed. &#x201c;Now stop that!&#x201d; she cried, quickly pushing the skirt down. She realized belatedly that she should have worn slacks on this trip. But she had wanted to look dainty and feminine, because she would probably meet one of the Good Magician&#x2019;s five and a half wives. After she got through the challenges that would bar entry to the castle, of course. The Good Magician always had three challenges, to discourage those who weren&#x2019;t really serious about their quests for information. He didn&#x2019;t like to be bothered frivolously. Then something clicked in her pretty little head. The challenges! This must be the first one! The disreputable cloud must owe the Good Magician a debt, and so was doing him a Service. It wasn&#x2019;t coincidence at all. She had to figure out how to get past Fracto. That put an entirely different complexion on it. Her own comely little complexion relaxed. All she had to do was figure out how to get past this messy old cloud, and she would&nbsp;be a third of the way through. There was always a way; she just had to find it. Could she insult Fracto, and make him blow himself out? That was the way Grundy Golem would do it. But Grundy had a mouth that was the envy of harpies; he could spew out insults faster than they could. Gloha was half harpy, because her father was Hardy Harpy, so she should be able to spew out a stinking stream of invective. But somehow she had never cared to acquire that ability. Her mother was Glory Goblin, who was beautiful and good, and Gloha just preferred to emulate her. If her brother Harglo were here,&nbsp; <i>he</i>&nbsp;could have let out an oath that burned a hole in the cloud. But this was a challenge she had to handle by herself. So steaming Fracto was out. Avoiding him seemed to be out too, because he was hovering right over the castle she had to reach, by no accident. What was left? Outsmarting him? She just knew she was smarter than a creature whose brain was swirling vapor, but how could she prove it? This seemed to be a situation in which intellect didn&#x2019;t count for much. All he had to do was sit there and wet on her if she tried to get through. Well, maybe she would just have to get wet. It wasn&#x2019;t as if she were made of spun sugar, whatever impression she preferred to give others. Gloha set her firm little face in an earnest little expression and flew directly toward where she hoped the castle was, on a level course. Fracto puffed up like a mottled wart. He opened his sodden maw and breathed out a sickly gust of wind. It surrounded her, coating her true little tresses with smog and her winsome little wings with dirty ice. Foul air clogged her nice little nose and fuzzed her open little eyes. Suddenly she was flying blind, and losing altitude. She was in danger of crashing! Gloha sneezed. The force of it shot her spinning back out of the foul air, and she was able to blink her eyes clear. She&nbsp;still had some altitude, and was able to pull out of her tailspin. She brought out her handsome little hankie and wiped her face. Fracto&#x2019;s ugly puss was laughing and spitting out broken bits of wind and cloud that drifted in stenchy colors. It seemed that she couldn&#x2019;t just try harder; the awful cloud had too much ill wind. Well, if she couldn&#x2019;t fly there, she would walk there. She was a goblin girl with harpy wings, and though she had spent most of her time with winged monsters, she was at home on the ground too. Fracto couldn&#x2019;t stop her from using her fast little feet. She glided down to the ground before the evil cloud could work up another foul gust to blow her away. She had hoped to find an enchanted path going there, but saw none. So her lovely little lady slippers touched down in an isolated glade, and she began to walk. There was an ordinary path that would serve; she had noted its direction as she descended, and was sure it would take her there. She would simply have to watch out for hostile monsters and other ilk, because they would be able to harass her on an unenchanted path. Fracto was furious. He huffed and he puffed and he blew up such a storm that in two and a half moments snow was pelting down. In the remaining half moment it was piling up so thickly that all trace of the path was gone. Oops. How was she to find her way now? She knew she would get lost in the trackless snow. She couldn&#x2019;t even make her own tracks, because the snow was covering them up just about as fast as she made them. In addition, it was cold; her tight little tootsies were freezing. She would have to take shelter until the storm blew over. Maybe she could find a blanket bush and hide under the blankets, and the snow would cover her so that Fracto wouldn&#x2019;t know where she was, and would drift away. At least she would be warm while she waited. But she saw no blanket bushes, and no pillow bushes.&nbsp;This glade was singularly bereft of useful plants. There was only a big snowball at the edge of the glade. She certainly didn&#x2019;t need that! But as her teeth began to chatter in an unladylike manner, her mind squeezed out an odd thought. What was a giant snowball doing here? The snow had just started, and it was covering the ground with a level layer. It couldn&#x2019;t form itself into a snowball. Was there an invisible giant doing it? But there was no depression where the snow would have been taken from, and there was no smell of giant. &#x201c;That snowball&#x2014;that&#x2019;s no ball,&#x201d; she muttered, making temporary tracks toward it. Then she realized that she had made a pun. &#x201c;That snowball&#x201d; had become &#x201c;That&#x2019;s no ball,&#x201d; spoken the same way. And that gave her the cue. She marched up to the ball and touched it. Her hands passed through its seeming surface. She stepped forward, and found herself within the entrance to a tunnel. It looked like a snowball from outside, but it was warm and dry inside. This was the way past Fracto&#x2019;s storm. All she had had to do was figure out the secret, and she was on her way. Her mild little mind had prevailed over the cloud&#x2019;s fury, and she had mastered (or maybe mistressed) the first challenge. But there would be two more, and they wouldn&#x2019;t be any easier than the first. She had gotten through as much by luck as by wit, and might have used up her supply of both. Should she give up her quest? But then she would never find her Perfect Mate and True Love, and would have to endure unhappily forever and ever alone, which was a fate worse than marriage. She wasn&#x2019;t ready to face that dreary prospect. After all, she had so much to offer the right man, she hoped. She glanced down at her fancy little figure, just to be sure. So she proceeded resolutely down the passage. She would at least make an efficient little effort, and if she failed, then she would go somewhere and cry. The passage opened out into a good-sized lighted cave.&nbsp;Along the sides were darkened alcoves, and at the far end was a monster. Uh-oh&#x2014;she suspected that the next challenge was upon her. Instead of a cantankerous cloud, she would have to get by an aggressive animal. But there had to be a way to do it without getting eaten. She merely had to figure out that way again. Somehow. Maybe if she proceeded very carefully it would happen. So she took a tour of the chamber, looking in the alcoves. This turned out to be a slightly baffling tour. The first alcove held a fat bird with a beautiful fan-shaped tail. Gloha cudgeled her balky little brain and managed to remember news of a bird like this, perhaps confined to Mundania: it was a turkey. She looked at it, and it looked at her, and that was it. The bird wasn&#x2019;t confined, but didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to depart its alcove. It was just there. &#x201c;You certainly are a beautiful bird,&#x201d; Gloha said politely. The turkey gobbled appreciatively. She moved on to the next alcove. There was a rather unprepossessing young human man. Because he was human, he was about twice as tall as she was; goblins were twice as tall as elves and half as tall as humans. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how either other species could stand being so pitifully small or so dangerously large, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be polite to call attention to such failings, so she didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;I say, can you talk?&#x201d; she asked the youth, who seemed to be no older than she was, though it was hard to tell with humans. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; the youth replied. &#x201c;What is your name? Mine is Gloha.&#x201d; &#x201c;Sam.&#x201d; He did not seem to be much for conversation. &#x201c;What are you doing here, Sam, if I may ask?&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m part of your challenge.&#x201d; That was certainly direct! &#x201c;And what is your role in this challenge?&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a flunky.&#x201d; &#x201c;A flunky? I don&#x2019;t think I know that position.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t respond. She realized that he merely answered&nbsp;questions, and as briefly as possible. Naturally the challenge creatures didn&#x2019;t volunteer much information. &#x201c;What does a flunky do?&#x201d; she asked. Then she was afraid he would just say that he flunked. But Sam did give a meaningful response, fortunately. &#x201c;He does stupid errands for other folk.&#x201d; &#x201c;What errand will you do for me?&#x201d; &#x201c;None.&#x201d; So much for that. That time she might almost have preferred a less straight answer. She moved on. The next alcove held a tub of dirty water. That didn&#x2019;t seem to be of much interest, so she went to the following one. That alcove held a large four-footed animal, like a unicorn without a horn, with long ears. &#x201c;Hello, creature,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Hee-haw!&#x201d; it brayed back. That gave her the cue. It was a Mundane donkey. The next alcove held a sort of springlike metal thing sitting on a step. There were several steps, but it wasn&#x2019;t using them. But when she came to stand before it, it leaned over and its top end toppled to land on the next step below. The rest of it followed smoothly, making a turn from the upper pile of itself to the lower pile, until all of it was down. Immediately it bent again, and started sinuously transferring itself to the next step. When it reached the bottom of the little stairway, it stopped. That was all. The next alcove held a vaguely humanoid creature with a most versatile tail. It jumped from bar to bar, swinging with its hands, feet, or tail. It moved very cleverly, never missing a bar, never falling. It chittered at her from its furry face. She pondered, and realized that this was another odd creature: a monkey. So it went: each alcove held a creature or thing. They were all part of her challenge. But how did they relate? She could see nothing similar about them; this was like a little zoo with assorted displays. At the far end was the monster. It stood taller than she was, on all fours, with a huge powerful foresection and a rather small hind section. It was in no alcove; it was in the exit from the chamber. She realized that she had to get by it, but the moment she approached it, it rose up and snarled with such ferocity that she had to step quickly back. It wasn&#x2019;t confined or chained, but it didn&#x2019;t pursue her. She realized that this was the one she would have to deal with. So she stiffened her knocking little knees and came to stand just beyond the monster&#x2019;s snarl range. &#x201c;If I may inquire,&#x201d; she said in her most timidly civil little voice, &#x201c;what are you?&#x201d; The monster eyed her appraisingly. He licked his formidable chops. &#x201c;Hi. I am the Yena,&#x201d; she said. Gloha blinked. She had thought the monster was male. She looked again, trying not to blush because of the impolite nature of the act, and saw that it was indeed male. She must have misheard. &#x201c;The Yena?&#x201d; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I said, goblin girl,&#x201d; she replied. Gloha looked yet again. The monster was female. How could she have thought otherwise? &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said faintly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome, you tasty little tart,&#x201d; he said. Gloha found herself getting confused and embarrassed. Once she had passed the magical age of eighteen she had sought information about the secrets hidden by the dread Adult Conspiracy, and had been somewhat disappointed when she learned their nature; she had almost wished she hadn&#x2019;t bothered. But she had gotten it straight, she thought. Now she wasn&#x2019;t sure. How could she be sure, when the creature&#x2019;s unmentionable region kept changing?

One Woman to Blame: Their Mother<br>In March of 1949, a healthy baby boy named Richard Noe entered this world. Thirty-one days later, he left it -- found dead in his parents' bedroom in a working-class Philadelphia neighborhood. Over the next nineteen years, all nine of Marie and Arthur Noe's other children would die -- one stillborn, one in the hospital, and the other seven of unexplained causes--none lived longer than fifteen months.<br><br>Gaining national sympathy for their unbelievabloe bad luck, the Noes were deemed victims of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). But as the years went on, may people found their SIDS defence a hard pill to swallow -- after all, SIDS is not a hereditary condition. As investigators proved, they found that in each case, the child had died while home alone with Marie Noe.<br><br>Finally, in 1999 -- fifty years after her first child died -- septuagenarian Maried Noe pled guilty to killing eight of her ten dead children. Today, she remains at home on probation helping psychiatric experts understand what is perhaps one of the most disturbing and baffling mysteries of all: how and why a mother could kill her own children.

American Street with Constance, Marie decided to celebrate her baby's one-month anniversary by training her to sit up in a chair. Placing the tiny baby on a chair in the parlor, she arranged one pillow behind her and set another chair in front to support her so she wouldn't topple over. Suddenly Constance began to cry and Marie lost control."I don't know why," she would later confess, "but then I took a pillow and laid her down on the chair and I suffocated her."Then in a dream-like state Marie carefully carried Constance to her crib and closed her eyes as if she was asleep. Then she left the room and went upstairs to the bathroom to compose herself. There she remained until she heard her husband come through the front door.Copyright � 2000 by John Glatt.</p><h2>Bible: Family Flip Quiz (Family Flip Quiz series)</h2><p>Improve your family&#x2019;s knowledge of the Bible!

A "fanciful creature of undefined nature," it was also once the wisest, kindest, most fun-loving living thing in the world--until people stopped believing in it. When that lack of faith became widespread, the last of the really great Whangdoodles created a special land full of extraordinary creatures: furry Flukes, the sly High-Behind Splintercat, and the wonderful Whiffle Bird. But when an open-minded professor--the one adult who still believes in the Whangdoodle--joins forces with three children with active imaginations, they become an unstoppable team on a fantastic and sometimes terrifying journey to Whangdoodleland. <p> Readers who have explored Narnia, Oz, or Willy Wonka's chocolate factory will be thrilled at this new destination--a marvelous land that will inspire and stimulate creative and scientific minds. And who better to expose young readers to new ways of seeing, smelling, and hearing than Julie (Andrews) Edwards of <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>The Sound of Music</i> fame? Her lively and clever style pulls readers along effortlessly; she, like the professor, is one grownup who can teach children never to close their minds to possibility. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><p>The Whangdoodle was once the wisest, the kindest, and the most extraordinary creature in the world. Then he disappeared and created a wonderful land for himself and all the other remarkable animals -- the ten-legged Sidewinders, the little furry Flukes, the friendly Whiffle Bird, and the treacherous, "oily" Prock. It was an almost perfect place where the last of the really great Whangdoodles could rule his kingdom with "peace, love and a sense of fun"-- apart from and forgotten by people. </p><p>But not completely forgotten. Professor Savant believed in the Whangdoodle. And when he told the three Potter children of his search for the spectacular creature, Lindy, Tom, and Ben were eager to reach Whangdoodleland. </p><p>With the Professor's help, they discovered the secret way. But waiting for them was the scheming Prock, who would use almost any means to keep them away from his beloved king. Only by skill and determination were the four travelers able to discover the last of the really great Whangdoodles and grant him his heart's desire. </p><p>Julie Andrews Edwards, star of stage and screen, has written a unique and beloved story that has become a modern classic. <em>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles</em> is sure to continue to delight readers everywhere. This edition includes a new foreword by the author. </p></p><h2>Ivan the Terrible</h2><p>The author of the best-selling Tolstoy, winner of France's prestigious Prix Goncourt, member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise, and renowned expert on Russia paints yet another indelible portrait of one of Russia's imposing historical figures. Henri Troyat, author of acclaimed biographies of Catherine the Great, Tolstoy, and Turgenev, turns his attention to one of the most violent, demented rulers ever, Czar Ivan IV. Though this larger-than-life ruler inflicted torture on friends and enemies alike, destroyed villages and even killed his own son, he also forged what became 20th-century Russia.<br></p><p>Henri Troyat was born a Russian Jew in 1911 (Lev Trassov), but was educated in France. He is a member of the Academie Francaise, and in 1938 he won the Prix Goncourt. He has written biographies, novels, short stories, essays and travel books.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Taken By Storm: The Troubled Science, Policy and Politics of Global Warming</h2><p>TAKEN BY STORM explores the science, policy and debate over global warming. <p>The physical phenomena in climate and weather are among the most complex in nature, and science can say very little about what they will do in the future. Yet a large international policy framework has been built precisely on the assumption that we know what is happening and how to control it. In TAKEN BY STORM, Christopher Essex and Ross McKitrick prove this assumption false, carefully explaining the science of climate change and deconstructing the widespread myth of global warming. They argue that the connection between between science and society is disintegrating, and they propose a vital first step toward repairing this relationship.</p></p><p>Dr. Christopher Essex is a Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario, specializing in the underlying mathematics, physics and computation of complex dynamical processes such as climate. He is a visiting professor at the Niels Bohr Institute's Orsted Laboratory, and previously served as an NSERC visiting fellow at the Canadian Climate Centre and an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow. <p>Dr. Ross McKitrick is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Guelph (Ontario) and a Senior Fellow of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, B.C. He specializes in the application of economic analysis to environmental policy design and climate change.</p>Beginning of the Preface <p>"In the realm of the seekers after truth there is no human authority. Whoever attempts to play the magistrate there founders on the laughter of the Gods." <br>- Albert Einstein </p><p>You&#x2019;ve heard it, we&#x2019;ve heard it: Global warming is the greatest threat facing humanity. One hundred Nobel laureates recently signed a statement saying so. A UN panel of scientists says so. Our governments say so. Can all these people be wrong? </p><p>Of course they can. Whether the earth is warming or not is a scientific question, not a political one. The scientists who have spoken out about global warming understand this. They know that they can be wrong, and they know that what they believe is not necessarily the same as what is true, no matter how passionate their feelings may be. </p><p>If you believe that Nobel laureates can never be wrong, or that UN panels never make mistakes, then be advised that science doesn&#x2019;t work that way. Our first task in this book is to convince you that that Nobel laureates are probably wrong about global warming and that most of what you have been hearing about it is wrong. That will actually be the easy part. The claim that there is a global warming crisis threatening to bring chaos and destruction upon the world is so feeble you were probably feeling somewhat skeptical anyway. You were right- and we&#x2019;ll show you why. </p><p>Our second task is to try and explain why so many people including many smart, famous and high-profile individuals, have gotten so confused on this topic. This will be somewhat more difficult, wrapped up as it is in the complex dynamics at the interface of politics and science, while submerged in a soup of pseudo-science and fear. We believe there has been no conspiracy to dupe the public and the people in question have nothing but the best of intentions. It appears instead that a lot of well-meaning people got locked unwittingly into a game that requires them to speak as if they are absolutely certain about matters upon which certainty is inherently impossible. Many prominent players have staked their reputations on positions that cannot be supported by science or sound policy analysis. Consequently a debate in a free and open marketplace of ideas can&#x2019;t happen. Instead, what we get looks more like a fortress, heavily defended by an arsenal of authoritarian pronouncements designed to intimidate outsiders into staying away. Rhetorical weapons like the statement of the 100 Nobel laureates, and others we have seen like it in the past year, would never be used in a real scientific debate. That big players in this issue feel a need for this sort of cannonade just shows how far we have departed from sensible intellectual practice on what remains, even today, an open scientific question. </p><p>This leads us to our third and most difficult task. We will try to look beyond the global warming issue itself and ask how we should make public policy in cases where the underlying science is uncertain. What we end up suggesting will not look anything like the process used around global warming. That will serve as an example of what not to do. We will argue for a new approach in which non-scientists stop looking for shortcuts around the hard work of learning science, and high-ranking scientists stop resorting to authoritarian grandstanding as an easy substitute for the slow work of research, debate and persuasion. </p><p>Global warming ceased to be a subject of scientific debate years ago. Watch how critics jump straight to an examination of motives or credentials rather than the substance of an author&#x2019;s argument whenever books like this one are published. The argument, it seems, is that what you say, whether it is true or not, matters less than the way you say it or who you are. Scrutinizing the messenger rather than the message may be an effective political ploy; but what we are engaged in is not, at its heart, a political question. Our society has already done substantial harm to itself by not grasping this crucial point. </p><p>For those of you who will find this book threatening, and instinctively grasp for this sort of defense, you&#x2019;re in luck. While we have neither sought nor received any industry funding for writing this book, the fact is our "green" credentials are pretty pathetic. We like civilization and all its artificial material comforts. Trees and lakes are nice to have around, but so are paved roads and warm buildings. We find recycling and the whole blue box thing a bit of a sacred cow. We generally prefer driving to walking, especially when transporting kids, except for very short distances. We don&#x2019;t care if people drive subcompacts or SUV&#x2019;s &#x2013; that&#x2019;s their business. Live and let drive. We eat meat, use pesticides on our lawns and avoid using public transit if possible. We think people who pay extra to buy "organic" vegetables are basically suckers. One of us even smoked cigarettes (for a while anyway). We have no idea when Earth Day is, nor do we care, as long as the mall stays open. </p><p>So there. If you are worried that this book may unravel some of your cherished beliefs about global warming, just gently close the cover and put it back on the shelf. Tell yourself these two horrible people are so out of touch with nature they couldn&#x2019;t possible be trusted.</p></p><h2>The Legend of Drizzt Collector&#39;s Edition, Book IV</h2><p>Complete your collection!<br><br><b>The Legend of Drizzt</b>� Collector&#x2019;s Edition, Book IV collects the last three novels in the best-selling series: <i>The Silent Blade, The Spine of the World</i> and <i>Sea of Swords</i> in a deluxe hardcover edition.<br><br>Though they&#x2019;ve managed to save Wulfgar&#x2019;s body from captivity in the Abyss, Drizzt and his companions come to realize that a part of the barbarian&#x2019;s soul may have been left behind&#x2013;but all they can do is let Wulfgar take his own path.

Don't know what to say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Love</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And Tom Hope was left injured in a way that seemed certain to kill him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stood at the wooden table in the kitchen reading again and again what she'd written. He thought: It was the rain. He pictured her standing on the verandah in her blue dress and her cardigan while the rain came down day after day from a gray sky. He read the note one more time. It was written on the pink notepaper she'd used on special occasions and dated September 10, 1962. She'd also left behind a piece of toast from which she'd taken a single bite. The indent preserved the arc of her teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He kept to the farm for weeks after she'd gone. He knew what would happen if he drove into Hometown: How's the missus, Tom? from every direction-and he had no answer. He worked in a daze, holding himself together as best he could. Cleared the channels in the orchard, a good five days, then repaired the wire fences of the hill pastures ready for the woollies in spring. He had never wept in his life but these days his cheeks were tear-streaked all the time. When he noticed, he would shrug: What did it matter?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She barely had any family: her father missing up in New South Wales; her mother and sister, Tilly, living with some Bible bashers who'd taken them down to Phillip Island. Where could she have gone?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He couldn�t stay on the farm forever. He needed tobacco, sugar, tea. He needed Aspros. He woke with a headache every morning. In town, first one friend then another expressed surprise at his long absence. When he was asked how his wife was faring, he said, �Oh, she went on her way.� He didn�t elaborate. He thought, I�m meant to be alone. He had more reason than Trudy running away to make him believe this. He�d always been awkward with people. He had to remind himself to smile. But in his heart he yearned for people all around him. Only let them not ask him to talk and smile too much. Let them just say: �Tom, good to see you,� and, �Tom, look in one time and say hello to the kids.� Animals forgave his unease. The mare he�d bought for Trudy to enjoy obeyed him, never her. His dog, Beau, an old heeler, loved him in the way of dogs. But then, Beau loved everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Listening to the radio one evening, he understood suddenly a comment she�d made not so long before she left. She had talked a lot when she was playing the game with the three decks of cards, such things as: �Clever girl!� and �Whoops-a-daisy!� But the comment Tom had just recalled was different. At the time, he�d thought it part of her strange three-deck game. It wasn�t. It was something intended for him. �Another night in paradise,� she�d said, moving one small pile of cards to the edge of the low table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom stood up from his armchair and stared straight ahead. Why had it taken him so long to understand? Another night in paradise. He stamped through the house, arms folded tight over his chest. All the things he might have done to make his wife happy crowded his mind. A record player. Songs that she could choose for herself. A television set on hire to purchase. A proper bathtub, not that half-rusted tin thing. He ran to the kitchen and found a piece of paper and a black pencil. In a frenzy, he wrote a list of the things he would do to make a difference if Trudy should one day come back. Whenever a new idea came to mind, he rushed back to the kitchen and added it to the list:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6-Picnics!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7-Pets cat budgie!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8-Light fire kitchen first thing!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outside, Beau ran yelping along the verandah from the back door to the side door, excited by the movement inside the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More items occurred to him over the following days. Tell her about good things she does. Such as what? Like when she doesn�t burn the sausages. And when he�d had that pain in the guts, she�d asked him three times if he was feeling better. Like when she says how are you feeling. But one afternoon in the kitchen for a cuppa he glanced down at his list on the table and noticed how hard he�d pressed the pencil into the paper. This was mad, wasn�t it, making notes? Tell Beau not to jump up on her. An image formed of Beau listening to him, head cocked. Tom smiled and made a mental note on a different list: Don�t be an idiot. Trudy had told him once, smiling, that he was �unbalanced� given the way that he�d stick with some problem about the farm for hours, for days, studying the habits of the codling moth until he�d all but indexed the physical and mental processes of the insect. She�d mimicked him perfectly, the way he wandered up and down, arms crossed, head on his chest, mumbling his thoughts. He�d enjoyed the mickey-taking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom�s sisters drove up from Melbourne in Patty�s big Ford to see to him. He�d been their big brother in their growing-up years but at some point, one sister then the other had adopted a protective way of handling him. It was as if their developing experience with men had made them aware that their brother lacked a type of male insistence, often very stupid insistence but maybe necessary. He was solid with men, respected by them; but a woman of a certain sort, they clearly believed, could get away with murder. And Trudy was evidently that sort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to Tom in his letters taking all the blame on himself! The sisters had come to the farm with a message: Get over her, Tommy love, and move on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom had only the one strategy for dealing with his sisters when they fussed: He became carefree. Making tea in the kitchen, Patty called over her shoulder: "More fool her if she doesn't want our handsome Tom!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom said, "Probably for the best!" and smiled as if he were well on top of the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Claudie said, "Her and her crosswords!" She meant the crosswords in the Sun newspaper that Trudy had pored over, chewing her pencil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patty called cleverly, "I'd give her a cross word or two if she turned up now, I can tell you!" and the three of them laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the sisters left for home in the middle of the afternoon, Tom heaved a sigh of relief. But the relief was succeeded by a plunge of sadness. He had said one or two things critical of Trudy for his sisters' sake and now he felt like a traitor. "Damn you for that!" he said aloud to himself. He added to his second-chance list of ideas a new item, number 34: Don't blame her for things!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A big southeasterly took a sheet of iron off the dairy roof the day Trudy returned. Tom was up a ladder in the late afternoon hammering the sheet back in place when he saw her. The Melbourne bus must have dropped her off on the town road. Everything in the world came to a stop except for Trudy struggling up the drive with her suitcase. It had been raining for a month, just as it had been when she ran off, and it was raining now. The first words that came to Tom when blood returned to his brain were: �Thank God!� He hurtled down the ladder two rungs at a time and strode to meet his wife with all the unused joy of twelve months swelling his heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When they met halfway up the drive he wrapped his arms around her, he couldn't help it. "I'll take this," he said, picking up her suitcase. Trudy was sobbing. Even in the rain, face all wet, her tears still showed in their passage down her cheeks. "Don't cry, love," said Tom, but Trudy's shoulders continued to heave with the rigor of her weeping.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once in the kitchen, Tom helped his wife off with her red overcoat and sat her by the warm stove. He brought her a towel for her hair but, although she accepted it with a whispered, "Thank you," she didn't use it. She sat with the towel on her lap sobbing and shaking. Tom stood behind her with his hands on her shoulders. He said, "There, love. Don't cry now." Every now and again in her weeping, Trudy struggled out the word, "Sorry!" and once managed a little more: "Tommy, I'm sorry!" Tom was looking down on the tangled, wet mess of her fair hair. As Trudy sobbed, Tom drew the strands of her hair back from her face with his fingertips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom didn�t presume that Trudy would wish to share their marriage bed that night and was prepared to sleep on the sofa. But no, she insisted that he climb in beside her. She had recovered from her sobbing and something like her old, soft smile had returned. There was nothing wrong with her appetite, either: She ate a huge plate of bubble and squeak and, on top of that, a whole tin of peaches with fresh cream. And she spent almost an hour in the bathtub before bed once Tom fired up the water heater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy wore to bed a pink satin nightdress that Tom had never seen before. It had been her custom before she ran off to wear pajamas at night. Tom was careful not to touch her and only lay still beside her in the dark, smiling at his good fortune. Nor did he ask for explanations. It was Trudy who spoke first, and it was Trudy who drew herself close to him. The soapy smell of his wife could almost have burst Tom's heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tom," she said, "I went a little bit mad."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes," said Tom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you know what I want? I want to forget all that. I want to forget it forever."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes," said Tom. "Forget it forever."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I missed you so much, oh so much, darling! Did you miss me like that?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Very much," said Tom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She kissed him. Nothing on earth was as soft as her lips, nothing. She stroked his face. If he'd had the words, he would have blessed her for coming back to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She kissed him harder and said, "Will you make love to me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you want that?" said Tom. It was something he'd refused to hope for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy sat up in bed and lifted her nightdress over her head, lay down again and pressed herself to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Darling man."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom agonized over the list of ideas. He wanted to show it to Trudy but feared it would seem foolish to her. She was the one with the education, two more years of high school than Tom�s father had thought enough for him. A sophisticated person might consider his list a bit childish-he could see that. In the end, though, he decided that he must show her. Her mood on the first two days of her return was the best he could remember, but on days three and four she�d seemed glum. Tom hoped with all his heart that the list would cheer her up again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's this?" she said. She was still in bed but roused herself to accept a breakfast cup of tea and Tom's six sheets of notepaper. Her bedside light was on. She'd been reading her book and had dozed off. The book lay open and face-up on Tom's vacant side of the bed. The cover picture showed a young woman with long golden hair shielding her breasts with loose crimson fabric. Two men leaned over her, one at each shoulder. A crusader knight and, as Tom surmised, a sultan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Some ideas I had," said Tom. He sat on the side of the bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy read slowly, sipping her tea at intervals. She didn't say anything. Tom managed not to ask her what she thought of the list while she was still reading. When she was away he'd forgotten how pretty she was, how the brown of her eyes caught the light and gleamed. He wanted now to stroke her hair and to breathe in the sleepy smell of her skin. He thought, I should've shaved!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy put the list down on the little table beside the bed. "Oh, Tom," she said. She lay back on her pillow and covered her face with her arm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom in his dread didn't move. Then found the courage to stroke his wife's hair. "What is it, Trudy?" he said. "What's wrong?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyes covered, she said something that Tom didn't quite catch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy uncovered her face. Her eyes were wet and glowing. She reached up and took hold of Tom's shirt just below the neck and kneaded the fabric between two fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm pregnant."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Pregnant?" said Tom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Tom, I wouldn't blame you if you threw me out. I truly wouldn't."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Tom leaned back, the air came out of his lungs with a sound like a sigh. It was as if his body couldn't be sure that it was supposed to keep going. Finally he said, "There was someone else?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trudy didn't say anything. She was watching her husband's face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom said, "Excuse me." He walked out to the verandah and let the screen door slam behind him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Dear God!" he said under his breath. So much was ruined. When his father died it was like this. So much ruined. A healthy man, who strode about like a king, killed in a week by a sickness that didn't even have a proper name. And then his mother died a year later when her heart packed up, and not the least warning. Tom looked up at the hills and said again, "Dear God!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But even in his shock and disappointment he knew there would be no throwing out. He heard her voice behind him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was standing inside the screen door, barely visible in the shadows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tom didn't speak. Her form became more distinct as his eyes adjusted. He could see the sheen of tears on her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We'll work it out," she said. "Please let's work it out, Tom? We can, can't we?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was noticed in Hometown, Trudy�s baby-well, naturally. She must be, what-four or five months now? And she�d been back with Tom no more than three months-about that? Or maybe Tom had been seeing her before she came back, wherever she was. Do you think? Anyone with hide enough to ask Tom Hope if his wife�s baby was his, good luck to him, or her. And if it wasn�t, did Tom even know? Bev Cartwright from up on the floodplain, who had been close to Tom�s uncle Frank, told anyone who raised the matter: �Do you think he�s an idiot? Tommy�s an intelligent man.�</p></p><h2>Caroline Kepnes Collection 3 Books Set (You, Hidden Bodies, Providence)</h2><p><b>Please Note That The Following Individual Books As Per Original ISBN and Cover Image In this Listing shall be Dispatched Collectively:</b> <br> <br> <b>Caroline Kepnes Collection 3 Books Set:</b> <br> <br> <b>You:</b> <br> When aspiring writer Guinevere Beck strides into the bookstore where Joe works, he is instantly smitten.But there's more to Joe than Beck realises and much more to Beck than her perfect facade.

Each problem is illustrated with a typical beginner's picture, while the suggested solution features the work of a professional painter dealing with a similar subject. In many cases, there are close-up details which reveal the artist's technique, and further paintings showing alternative solutions to a problem.<br>The problems cover a wide spectrum. Some of them are technical, for example, how do you mix colors without overworking? What governs the choice of paper color, and what effect will this have? But making a successful painting is not just a matter of mastering the medium, and many of the problems relate to the wider concerns of painting, such as composition and the use of color. Some are subject-based; for example, how do you paint clouds or shadows convincingly, or render the brilliant colors and delicacy of flowers?<br>Whether you are considering trying out pastels or have already begun to work in the medium and feel you need some help, The Pastel Painter's Solution Book is for you.

The history of sex is as old as life itself&#x2014;and as complicated and mysterious. And despite centuries of study there is always more to know. In 2008, paleontologist John A. Long and a team of researchers revealed their discovery of a placoderm fish fossil, known as &#x201c;the mother fish,&#x201d; which at 380 million years old revealed the oldest vertebrate embryo&#x2014;the earliest known example of internal fertilization. As Long explains, this find led to the reexamination of countless fish fossils and the discovery of previously undetected embryos. As a result, placoderms are now considered to be the first species to have had intimate sexual reproduction or sex as we know it&#x2014;sort of.&nbsp;Inspired by this incredible find, Long began a quest to uncover the paleontological and evolutionary history of copulation and insemination. In <i>The Dawn of the Deed, </i>he takes readers on an entertaining and lively tour through the sex lives of ancient fish and exposes the unusual mating habits of arthropods, tortoises, and even a well-endowed (16.5 inches!) Argentine Duck. Long discusses these significant discoveries alongside what we know about reproductive biology and evolutionary theory, using the fossil record to provide a provocative account of prehistoric sex. <i>The Dawn of the Deed</i> also explores fascinating revelations about animal reproduction, from homosexual penguins to monogamous seahorses to the difficulties of dinosaur romance and how sexual organs in ancient shark-like fishes actually relate to our own sexual anatomy.<i>&nbsp;</i><i>The Dawn of the Deed </i>is Long&#x2019;s own story of what it&#x2019;s like to be a part of a discovery that rewrites evolutionary history as well as an absolutely rollicking guide to sex throughout the ages in the animal kingdom.

Two women, totally unalike in background, personality and social class, are brought together by a shared fascination with the philosophical movement founded by the late Anna Granite (read Ayn Rand). Justine is a chic journalist who wants to write an article about the followers of Granite's philosophy, Definitism. Dorothy is an obese, nocturnal word processor who answers Justine's advertisement in Manhattan Thing and offers to be interviewed about her involvement with the Definitists. As the two women come to know each other, their dismal life experiences gradually emerge, and their present circumstances are seen as a repetition of past connections and betrayals. This is a hard, edgy book, and Gaitskill's energy and flashy intelligence notwithstanding, the perhaps deliberate lack of polish ultimately detracts. The novel's raw, unsparing view is like that of certain contemporary paintings, and there are extraordinary moments of deeply examined female sexuality where Gaitskill is at her most original.

The sand was the color of cinnamon and spiked with green grass and felt cool on his feet, even though they were bruised and threaded with lesions that were probably infected. He got to his knees and wiped the bugs off the water and cupped it to his mouth with both hands, then washed his face in it and pushed his long hair out of his eyes. His skin was striped with dirt, his trousers streaked with salt from the dried sweat of the horse. For an instant he thought he saw his reflection in the surface of the pool. No, that was not he, he told himself. The narrow face and the shoulder-length hair and the eyes that were like cups of darkness belonged on a tray or perhaps to a crusader knight left to the mercies of Saracens.<br> <br>&#x201c;�Venga!&#x201d; he said to the horse. &#x201c;You have to be instructed to drink? It is no compliment to me that the only horse I could steal is probably the dumbest in Pancho Villa&#x2019;s army, a horse that didn&#x2019;t even have the courtesy to wear a saddle.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse made no reply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or is stupidity not the problem?&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Do you simply consider me an ogre to be feared and avoided? Either way, my sensibilities are fragile right now, and I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you would get your sorry ass down here.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the horse came down the embankment and began to drink, the man, whose name was Hackberry Holland, sat on a rock and placed his feet in a pool, shutting his eyes, breathing through his nose in the silence. It was a strange place indeed, one the Creator had shaped and beveled and backdropped with mountains that resembled sharks&#x2019; teeth, then had put away for purposes he did not disclose. There was no birdsong, no willow trees swelling with wind, no tinkle of cowbells, no windmill clanking to life, the spout drumming water into a galvanized tank. This was a feral land, its energies as raw and ravenous as a giant predator that ingested the naive and incautious, a place closer to hell than to heaven.<br> <br>He longed for a firearm and a canteen sloshing with water and a tall-crown hat and a pair of boots and soft socks and a clean shirt. It was not a lot to ask. Death was bad only when it was degrading, when it caught you sick and alone and lying on sheets soiled with your smell, your fears assembling around you like specters in the darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You see those two strings of smoke up on that mountain?&#x201d; he said to the horse. &#x201c;I suspect those are cook fires built by your former owners. Or by banditos that got no use for gringos from Texas. That means we&#x2019;re going to have to cross those mountains north of us, and other than the grass growing in this sand, there&#x2019;s probably not a cupful of feed between here and the Rio Grande. You think you&#x2019;re up to that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He rested his palms on his knees. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So I guess the big question is: What are we going to do? The answer is: I got no idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stared at the water rippling across the tops of his feet. A great weariness seemed to seep through his body, not unlike a pernicious opiate that told him it was time to rest and not quarrel with his fate. But death was not supposed to come like this, he told himself again. His fingernails were rimmed with dirt, his belt taken from him by his captors, his toes blackened with blood where they had been systematically stomped. He looked up at the sky. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re already circling,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll take me first, then they&#x2019;ll get to you, poor horse, whether you&#x2019;re breathing or not. I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s worked out this way. You didn&#x2019;t do nothing wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse lifted his head, ears forward, skin wrinkling from a blowfly that had lit on his rump.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Hackberry said.<br> <br>Then he turned his face to a breeze blowing down a slope not more than a hundred yards away. No, it wasn&#x2019;t simply a breeze. It smelled of mist and trees, perhaps pines, and thunderheads forming a lid above canyon walls. It smelled of cave air and fresh water and flowers that bloomed only at night; it smelled of paradise in a mountain desert. &#x201c;You reckon we found Valhalla? It&#x2019;s either that or I&#x2019;m losing my mind, because I hear music. You think you can make the climb up there, old pal?&#x201d;<br> <br>This time Hackberry didn&#x2019;t wait for a response. He picked up the horse&#x2019;s reins and led him up the embankment on the far side of the riverbed, convinced that his deliverance was at hand.<br> <br>HE WORKED THE horse up the incline through the entrance of the canyon and followed a trail around a bend scattered with fallen stone. A paintless one-story Victorian house, with a wide veranda and cupolas on the corners and fruit trees and two cisterns in back, was perched on a grassy bench with the voice of Enrico Caruso coming from a gramophone inside. The incongruity of the scene did not end there. A hearse, outfitted with brass carriage lamps and scrolled with paintings of white and green lilies and drawn by four white horses, was parked in front. There were red sores the size of quarters under the animals&#x2019; harnesses.<br> <br>At least a dozen horses were tethered to a rail, and others were picketed in the side yard. Some of the horses wore United States Army saddles. Beer and tequila bottles had been broken on the rocks along the trail that led to the yard. Just as the wind picked up, Hackberry&#x2019;s horse spooked sideways, walleyed, pitching his head against the reins.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, boy,&#x201d; Hackberry said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve probably ridden into a straddle house, although I must admit that hearse is a little out of the ordinary.&#x201d;<br> <br>The horse&#x2019;s nostrils were dilated, ears back. Hackberry dismounted and walked him up the grade, trying to see inside the hearse. Someone had restarted the recording. He could see no one through the windows. Directly above, the clouds had turned a shade of yellow that was almost sulfurous. The wind was cooler and blowing harder, creating a sound in the trees like water rushing through a riverbed. He seemed to have wandered into a magical place that had nothing to do with its surroundings. But he knew, just as the horse did, that sentiments of this kind about Mexico had no credibility and served no purpose. The campesinos were kept poor and uneducated; the police were corrupt; and the aristocracy was possessed of the same arrogance and cruelty that had given the world the Inquisition. Anyone who believed otherwise invited the black arts of both the savage and the imperialist into his life.<br> <br>He gave up on the hearse. The trees in the rear of the house had thick, dark green, waxy leaves and were shadowed by the canyon&#x2019;s walls. But something was wrong with the image, something that didn&#x2019;t fit with the ambiance that Gauguin would have tried to catch with his oils. Hackberry closed and opened and wiped his eyes to make sure his hunger and dysentery had not impaired his vision or released images that he kept walled away in his mind. No, there was no mistaking what had transpired in the canyon lidded by yellow clouds that seemed to billow like thick curds from a chemical factory. Four black men in army uniforms, two of them with their trousers pulled to their ankles, all of them in their socks, their hands bound behind them, had been hanged from the tree limbs, each dying on a separate tree, as though someone had used their death as part of an ornamental display.<br> <br>Hackberry turned the horse in a circle and began leading it back down the slope.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, hombre! �A d�nde vas?&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice said.<br> <br>A Mexican soldier in a khaki uniform had stepped out on the porch. He was thin and sun-browned and wore a stiff cap with a black bill and a gun belt he had cinched tightly into the flaps of his jacket. He had a narrow face and pits in his skin and teeth that were long and wide-set and the color of decayed wood. &#x201c;You look like a gringo, man,&#x201d; the soldier said. &#x201c;�No hablas espa�ol?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hackberry gazed idly around the yard. &#x201c;I cain&#x2019;t even habla ingl�s,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least not too good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a funny man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d; Hackberry paused and squinted innocuously at the sky. &#x201c;What is this place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know a casa de citas when you see one? How do you like what has been hung in the trees back there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mind my own business and don&#x2019;t study on other people&#x2019;s grief.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know you got a Mexican brand on your horse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I found him out in the desert. If you know the owner, maybe I can give him back. Can you tell me where I am?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to know where you are? You are in a big pile of shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why. I don&#x2019;t see myself as much of a threat to nobody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw you looking at the hearse. You bothered by corpses, man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Coffins and the like make me uneasy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a big liar, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those are hurtful words, unkind and unfair, particularly to a man in my circumstances. I&#x2019;d feel better if you would put that gun back in its holster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to hold my gun, man?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, cain&#x2019;t say as I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll give you the chance. Maybe you might beg to hold my gun. You get what I&#x2019;m saying, gringo?&#x201d; The officer&#x2019;s mouth had become lascivious.<br> <br>Hackberry stared at the figures suspended in the trees up the slope, at the way the limbs creaked and the figures swayed like shadows when the wind gusted. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d those colored soldiers do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did they do? They cried like children. What you think, man? What would you do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably the same. Tell you what. I cain&#x2019;t pay for food, but I&#x2019;ll chop wood for it. I&#x2019;d like to feed my horse, too. Then I&#x2019;d like to be on my way and forget anything I saw here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Mexican officer took a toothpick from his shirt pocket and put it in his mouth. His hair was black and thick and shiny and bunched out from under his hat. &#x201c;Some Texas Rangers attacked one of our trains and killed a lot of our people. You heard about that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hackberry glanced up at the clouds that were roiling like smoke. He rubbed the back of his neck as though he had a crick in it, his pale blue eyes empty. &#x201c;What would provoke them to do such a thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d tell you to ask them. But they&#x2019;re all dead. Except one. He got away. A tall man. Like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I still cain&#x2019;t figure why you hung those colored soldiers. Y&#x2019;all don&#x2019;t let them use your cathouses?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You ever seen dead people tied on car fenders? Tied on like deer full of holes? Americans did that in the village I come from. I saw it, gringo.&#x201d; The Mexican soldier drew down the skin below his right eye to emphasize the authenticity of his statement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never heard of that one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a tall gringo, even without boots. If we hang you up, you&#x2019;re gonna barely touch the ground. You&#x2019;re gonna take a long time dying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s my bad luck. Before you do that to me, maybe you can he&#x2019;p me out on something. Those soldiers back there were members of the Tenth or Eleventh Cavalry. There&#x2019;s a white captain with the Tenth I&#x2019;ve been looking for. You seen a young captain, not quite as tall as me, but with the same features?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Mexican removed the toothpick from his mouth and shook it playfully at Hackberry. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lots of fun, man. But now we&#x2019;re going inside and meet General Lupa. Don&#x2019;t talk shit to him. This is one guy you never talk shit to, you hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying he&#x2019;s not quite mature, even though he&#x2019;s a general in your army?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one way to put it, if you want to get your head blown off. The Texas Rangers I was talking about? They killed his son when they attacked the train.&#x201d;</p><h2>Bombay Time: A Novel</h2><p><br>At the wedding of a young man from a middle-class apartment building in Bombay, the men and women of this unique community gather together and look back on their youthful, idealistic selves and consider the changes the years have wrought. The lives of the Parsi men and women who grew up together in Wadi Baug are revealed in all their complicated humanity: Adi Patel's disintegration into alcoholism; Dosamai's gossiping tongue; and Soli Contractor's betrayal and heartbreak. And observing it all is Rusi Bilimoria, a disillusioned businessman who struggles to make sense of his life and hold together a fraying community. <br><br></p><p><br>Thrity Umrigar grew up in Bombay, India. A recipient of the Neiman Fellowship at Harvard, she writes for the <i>Beacon Journal</i> in Akron, Ohio. Her work has appeared in <i>The Washington Post</i>, and she is a contributor to the <i>Boston Globe</i>. She lives in Kent, Ohio.<br><br>The middle-class denizens of a Bombay apartment complex come to life in Umrigar's engaging debut, which tells the story of a half-dozen protagonists through the prism of a wedding hosted by respected lawyer Jimmy Kanga. Kanga's rise to glory is just one of several intriguing subplots. The novel begins with the story of Rusi and Coomi Bilimoria, a couple whose marriage becomes frayed when Rusi's business plans don't match his expectations and Coomi's mother-in-law turns out to be a live-in nightmare. Other interesting yarns include that of Dosamai, a bright young woman who, after her parents force her to marry down to ensure the future of her sisters, eventually turns into the local gossip. The neighborhood drunk, Adi Patel, also has a tale to tell involving a tragic interlude with the daughter of a laborer that effectively ruins his life, and the widow Tehmi Engineer takes an analogous road to ruin when her handsome husband, Cyrus, is killed in an explosion at a chemical plant. Umrigar is an accomplished, natural storyteller who remains an optimistic narrator despite all her grim plot twists, though she never softens the impact of the various tragedies on her characters. She also manages to work in a portrait of the decline of Bombay, delivering an impressive debut offering a glimpse into a cultural world especially that of the Parsis, an ethnic minority that most Westerners know only in its barest outlines.

After getting involved with the murders of local prostitutes in the town of Deva, Doctor Gaius Petreius Ruso needs to get out of town, so has volunteered for a posting with the Army on the volatile border where the Roman-controlled half of Britannia meets the independent tribes of the North. Not only is he going to the hinterlands of the hinterlands, but it his slave Tilla's homeland and she has some scores to settle there. Soon they find that Tilla's tribespeople are being encouraged to rebel against Roman control by a mysterious leader known as the Stag Man, and her former lover is implicated in the grisly murder of a soldier. Ruso, unwillingly involved in the investigation of the murder, is appalled to find that Tilla is still<b> </b>spending time with the lover. Worse, he is honour bound to try to prove the man innocent - and the Army wrong - by<b> </b>finding another suspect. Soon both Ruso's and Tilla's lives are in jeopardy, as is the future of their<b> </b>burgeoning romantic relationship.</p><p><p>Ruth Downie's first novel, <i>Medicus</i>, grew out of a story that won the Fay Weldon section of BBC3's <i>End of Story</i> competition. She is married with two sons and lives in Milton Keynes, England.</p>Ruso, a medic with ancient Rome's army, reluctantly gets involved in the investigation when the headless body of a centurion is found near his outpost in Brittania. The case could prove deadly for Ruso when his slave, Tilla, turns out to be an old flame of the prime suspect. Simon Vance gives Ruso a voice that combines conceit, genuine concern, and growing frustration, while making a large cast of characters instantly recognizable. Vance balances Downie's modern wit and her meticulously reconstructed Roman setting. As Ruso juggles murder, political considerations, and a shifting relationship with Tilla, strong characters and Vance's lively reading make this a delight.

Many have found that while the worksheets were developed for students with social learning challenges, many of the topics and related content on the worksheets will benefit virtually all students in the mainstream.</p><p></p><h2>What to Do When Your Mom or Dad Says &#34;Clean Your Room!&#34; (Survival Series for Kids)</h2><p>Provides instructions for making a bed, properly hanging and folding clothes, dusting, vacuuming, and systematically cleaning a dirty, messy, or disorganized bedroom</p><p></p><h2>Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being</h2><p>This critical work on Shakespeare attempts to show his complete works - dramatic and poetic - as a single, tightly-integrated, evolving organism. Identifying Shakespeare&#39;s use in the poems &#34;Venus and Adonis&#34; and &#34;The Rape of Lucrece&#34;, of the two most significant religious myths of the archaic world, Hughes argues that these myths later provided Shakespeare with templates for the construction of every play from &#34;All&#39;s Well that Ends Well&#34; to &#34;The Tempest&#34;. He also argues that this development, in turn, represented his poetic exploration of conflicts within the &#34;living myth&#34; of the English Reformation. The claim is a large one, but Hughes supports his thesis with a painstakingly close analysis of language, plots and characters.</p><p>Ted Hughes (1930-1998) was born in Yorkshire. His first book, The Hawk in the Rain, was published in 1957 by Faber &amp; Faber and was followed by many volumes of poetry and prose for adults and children. He received the Whitbread Book of the Year for two consecutive years for his last published collections of poetry, Tales from Ovid and Birthday Letters. He was Poet Laureate from 1984, and in 1998 he was appointed to the Order of Merit.For English poet Hughes, Shakespeare was "a prophetic shaman of the Puritan revolution," his plays mythic reenactments of the holy war between Catholic and Puritan fanaticism. This arcane, often farfetched study maintains that the Bard tapped into the "source myth" of Catholicism in Venus and Adonis : the myth of the Great Goddess and her sacrificed god. In The Rape of Lucrece , Shakespeare mined the rival source myth of Puritanism: the enraged Jehovan god who abhors the Goddess for her presumed treachery or whorishness. In this highly speculative analysis, Hughes follows the workings of these two interlocking myths through Shakespeare's plays, whose overall trajectory, he argues, is an attempt to escape from tragic destiny to secular freedom. In King Lear , according to Hughes, Shakespeare reinvented an ancient Egyptian cosmology to illuminate the distorting ethos of the English Reformation. And from Cymbeline to The Tempest , he argues, the Bard used the Gnostic myth about the Female who represents the hero's own soul. Hughes's ambitious critique will appeal primarily to devotees of myth and Jung. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Over the Top</h2><p>Drawing on his forty plus years as a world-class motivated speaker, Ziglar shows precisely how to achieve what people desire most from life -- to be happy, healthy, reasonably prosperous and secure, and to have friends, peace of mind, good family relationships and hope.</p><p>Zig Ziglar, one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in the country, delivers his message of humor, hope, and enthusiasm to audiences throughout the world.

Moses is our real founding father. </p> </blockquote> <p> The pilgrims quoted his story. Franklin and Jefferson proposed he appear on the U.S. seal. Washington and Lincoln were called his incarnations. The Statue of Liberty and Superman were molded in his image. Martin Luther King, Jr., invoked him the night before he died. Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama cited him as inspiration. For four hundred years, one figure inspired more Americans than any other. His name is Moses. </p> <p> In this groundbreaking book, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Bruce Feiler travels through touchstones in American history and traces the biblical prophet's influence from the <i>Mayflower</i> through today. He visits the island where the pilgrims spent their first Sabbath, climbs the bell tower where the Liberty Bell was inscribed with a quote from Moses, retraces the Underground Railroad where "Go Down, Moses" was the national anthem of slaves, and dons the robe Charlton Heston wore in <i>The Ten Commandments</i>. </p> <p> "Even a cursory review of American history indicates that Moses has emboldened leaders of all stripes," Feiler writes, "patriot and loyalist, slave and master, Jew and Christian. Could the persistence of his story serve as a reminder of our shared national values? Could he serve as a unifying force in a disunifying time? If Moses could split the Red Sea, could he unsplit America?" </p> <p> One part adventure story, one part literary detective story, one part exploration of faith in contemporary life, <i>America's Prophet</i> takes readers through the landmarks of America's narrative&#x2014;from Gettysburg to Selma, the Silver Screen to the Oval Office&#x2014;to understand how Moses has shaped the nation's character. </p> <p> Meticulously researched and highly readable, <i>America's Prophet</i> is a thrilling, original work of history that will forever change how we view America, our faith, and our future. </p> <strong>Photographs from <i>America's Prophet</i></strong><br> <b>(Click to See Full Image)</b><p></p> <table><tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The Hebrew Letter "Bet" <br> &#x201c;In every generation one should regard oneself as though he had come out of Egypt.&#x201d; The large letter &#x201c;bet&#x201d; contains the word &#x201c;bad&#x201d; and images of ancient Egypt at top and Nazi concentration camps at bottom.

Versatile narrator Samuel West heightens the continuing suspense and manages to sound thoughtful as Bowman struggles to learn the secrets of the Singer people.

S.C.A. � AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Dial 911 and Die</h2><p>The Shocking Truth About the Police Protection Myth</p><p>Americans need to know whether they are safe from violent crime. Many Americans believe the myth that they can simply &#34;dial 911&#34; and then just wait for the police to rescue them from danger. Dial 911 and Die explodes that myth with true stories from all over the country. It boils down to this: in most cases, the police do not have to protect ordinary private citizens from criminal attacks. The law and the courts shield the police departments and governments from liability. That means the citizens are left in the cold. When the thug breaks down your front door, is dialing 911 really your best defense? Americans and Canadians everywhere need to know, and Dial 911 and Die gives the answers. Don&#39;t become a victim to a false hope...read this book and get the facts.It was the most shocking thing I learned in law school. We had been studying how, under current law, you can sue for almost anything. You can sue a ladder manufacturer for failing to warn you that you might fall off. You can sue the phone company when a drunk driver crashes into a phone booth that you are using. You can sue your landlord for failing to take enough precautions to deter criminals from harming you on the property. A burglar can sue the homeowner when the crook trips and falls while burgling. In all these cases, the law courts said the product manufacturer, the phone company and the property owner "owed a legal duty" to prevent the accidents or protect the citizen. Turn the page, and prepare for a jolt: you cannot sue the government or the police for failing to protect you from crime. Whether liberal or conservative, almost everybody agrees that if there is one thing the government should do for the people, it should protect people from violent crime. Yet the law in most localities says that the government and police owe no legal duty to protect individual citizens from criminal attack. You don't hear this fact from the media and political figures. So, I wanted to inform every American and Canadian about it. People are worried about violent crime, but the authorities just hand them a telephone number to call. After reading this book I hope people will understand that they have a right and duty to protect themselves from criminal attack, and that nobody else can really do it for them. <p>Some people won't believe this message unless they see the law and the cases in black and white with footnotes. Dial 911 and Die tells the true stories, gives the law, and provides the legal references. Get one copy for yourself, and one extra copy to lend to skeptical friends and family members. It might just save a life.</p></p><h2>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</h2><p>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</p><p></p><h2>Bruce Catton&#39;s Civil War: Boxed 3 Volume Set</h2><p>Three Volume set includes: The Coming Fury, Terrible Swift Sword, and Never Call Retreat. A journalist and public official before becoming editor of American Heritage magazine, Bruce Catton won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his Civil War history A Stillness at Appomattox. As for this monumental Civil War trilogy, first published in the 1960s, historian Henry Steel Commager appraised: &#34;better than any other history of our Civil War it combines narrative vigor, literary grace, freshness of view and independence of judgment, and a kind of catholic spirit which embraces the whole vast tumultuous scene.&#34; The first volume opens with the Democratic Party&#39;s Charleston convention in 1860 and the split that resulted in two Democratic candidates, followed by the Republican Convention and Lincoln&#39;s victory. The country first drifted and then was swept into war, even as Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were declaring that a peaceful solution could be found. The second volume shows how the Union and Confederacy slowly reconciled themselves to an all-out war, and how the statures of Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jefferson Davis, and many others emerged. McClellan&#39;s character is impaled here in extracts from his arrogant letters. In the final volume, Lincoln remains resolute in the belief that a house divided against itself cannot stand, while Jefferson Davis struggles valiantly for political and economic stability. Catton traces the most bitter years of the war here, from the fighting at Fredericksburg to the surrender at Appomattox and the end of the Confederacy, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Each book includes a section of color maps, and the three volumes are contained in a blue and red box.</p><p></p><h2>Through the Wheat: The U.S. Marines in the First World War I</h2><p>U.S. Marine participation in World War I is known as a defining moment in the Marine Corps&#39; great history. It is a story of exceptional heroism and significant operational achievements, along with lessons learned the hard way. The Marines entered World War I as a small force of seagoing light infantry that had rarely faced a well-armed enemy. On a single June day, in their initial assault &#34;through the wheat&#34; on Belleau Wood against German machine-guns and poison gas shells, the Marines suffered more casualties than they had experienced in all their previous 142 years. Yet at Belleau Wood, Soissons, BlancMont, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse-Argonne the Marines proved themselves to be hard-nosed diehards with an affinity for close combat. Nearly a century later Belleau Wood still resonates as a touchstone battle of the Corps. Two retired Marines, well known for their achievements both in uniform and with the pen, have recorded this rich history in a way that only insiders can. Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Simmons and Col. Joseph H. Alexander recount events and colorful personalities in telling detail, capturing the spirit that earned the 4th Marine Brigade three awards of the French Croix de Guerre and launched the first pioneering detachments of &#34;Flying Leathernecks.&#34; Here, hand-to-hand combat seen through the lenses of a gas mask is accompanied by thought-provoking assessments of the war&#39;s impact on the Marine Corps.</p><p>Brig. Gen. Edwin Howard Simmons, USMC (Ret.) served in the Marine Corps for thirty-six years, from 1942 to 1978, and is a decorated veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He also served the Corps for seventeen years as a civilian, including many years as Director of Marine Corps History and Museums. He is the author of the Korean War novel <i>Dog Company Six</i>, <i>The United States Marines: A History</i>, and <i>Frozen Choisin: U.S. Marines at the Changjin Reservoir</i>, among other publications.

She experienced the gathering storm of the Revolutionary War and saw the battle of Bunker Hill from a hilltop near her home. The letters written by Abigail Adams to her friends and family bring the Revolutionary period alive, mingling details of everyday life with the momentous events of her time. Abigail Adams is given her own place in history in this award-winning biography, which captures the personality of its subject and the time in which she lived.</p><p><b>Natalie S. Bober</b>&nbsp;is an award-winning biographer and a historian with a long-standing interest in the eighteenth century.

She resides with her husband in Westchester County, New York, and derives great pleasure from her grandchildren, who happily serve as readers and critics of her books.Gr. 6^-12. Think of this biography as a portrait. Not the smooth, impassive painting reproduced on the jacket, but an intricate mosaic made of colorful bits of fact, emotion, period detail, and letters, letters, letters. Bober nudges readers to look beyond their twentieth-century expectations and become absorbed in another age. She creates a detailed eighteenth-century background showing Adams as the product of her times: an educated, intelligent, and capable woman in an age when the expectations and challenges of a woman's role were different from what they are today, but no less complex. Often separated from her husband John, Abigail wrote letters to him and to others constantly. Throughout the text, Abigail's voice is heard through quotations from her letters. Thorough research of this first-person resource gives Bober a comfortable familiarity with Abigail's personality as well as her personal history, which is interwoven with the turbulent history of her times. As in Bober's <i>Thomas Jefferson: Man on a Mountain</i> (1988), meticulous research and documentation give the book authority, good writing gives it clarity, and sympathetic understanding gives it humanity. An excellent biography. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Year of the Mad King: The Lear Diaries</h2><p>In 1982, rising actor and recent Royal Shakespeare Company arrival Antony Sher played the Fool to Michael Gambon's King in the RSC's production of <i>King Lear</i>. Shortly after, he came back to Stratford to play Richard III -- a breakthrough performance that would transform his career, winning him the Laurence Olivier, Evening Standard and Critics' Circle Theatre Awards for Best Actor. Sher's record of the making of this historic theatrical event, <i>Year of the King</i>, has become a classic of theatre writing, a unique insight into the creation of a landmark Shakespearean performance. <p></p><p> More than thirty years later, Antony Sher returned to <i>Lear</i>, this time in the title role, for the 2016 RSC production directed by Gregory Doran. Sher's performance was acclaimed by the <i>Telegraph</i> as "a crowning achievement in a major career," and the show transferred from Stratford to London's Barbican. Once again, he kept a diary, capturing every step of his personal and creative journey to opening night. </p><p></p><p> Like his <i>Year of the King</i> and <i>Year of the Fat Knight: The Falstaff Diaries</i> before it, <i>Year of the Mad King</i> offers a fascinating perspective on the process of one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation.</p></p><p>Born in Cape Town, Antony Sher came to London in 1968, and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy. He is now regarded as one of Britain&#39;s leading actors, as well as a respected author and artist. Much of his career has been with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he is an Associate Artist. He has played Richard III, Macbeth, Leontes, Prospero, Shylock, Iago and Falstaff, as well as the leading roles in Cyrano de Bergerac, Tamburlaine the Great, The Roman Actor, Tom Stoppard&#39;s Travesties, Peter Flannery&#39;s Singer, Athol Fugard&#39;s Hello and Goodbye, and Arthur Miller&#39;s Death of a Salesman. At the National Theatre he played the title roles in Primo (his own adaptation of Primo Levi&#39;s If This is a Man), Pam Gems&#39;s Stanley, Brecht&#39;s Arturo Ui, Shakespeare&#39;s Titus Andronicus (a co-production with the Market Theatre, Johannesburg), as well as Astrov in Chekhov&#39;s Uncle Vanya and Jacob in Nicholas Wright&#39;s Travelling Light. In the West End, his roles have included Arnold in Harvey Fierstein&#39;s Torch Song Trilogy, Muhammed in Mike Leigh&#39;s Goose-pimples, and Gellburg in Arthur Miller&#39;s Broken Glass. He played Freud in Terry Johnson&#39;s Hysteria at Bath&#39;s Theatre Royal and Hampstead Theatre. Film and television appearances include Mrs Brown, Alive and Kicking, The History Man, Macbeth and J.G. Ballard&#39;s Home. Following his debut as a writer with Year of the King (1985), an account of playing Richard III, he has written four novels - Middlepost, Indoor Boy, Cheap Lives and The Feast - as well as other theatre journals, Woza Shakespeare! (co-written with his partner, the director Greg Doran) and Primo Time. His autobiography Beside Myself was published in 2001. His plays include I.D. (premiered at the Almeida Theatre, 2003) and The Giant (premiered at Hampstead Theatre, 2007). He has published a book of his paintings and drawings, Characters (1989), and held exhibitions of his work at the National Theatre, the London Jewish Cultural Centre, the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield and the Herbert Gallery in Coventry. Among numerous awards, he has won the Olivier Best Actor Award on two occasions (Richard III/Torch Song Trilogy and Stanley), the Evening Standard Best Actor Award (Richard III), and the Evening Standard Peter Sellers Film Award (for Disraeli in Mrs Brown). On Broadway, he won Best Solo Performer in both the Outer Critics&#39; Circle and Drama Desk Awards for Primo. He has honorary Doctorates of Letters from the universities of Liverpool, Exeter, Warwick, and Cape Town. In 2000 he was knighted for his services to acting and writing.

Hinton (<i>The Outsiders</i>) has a female novelist penned such a tough and titillating portrait of lower-class, crime-ridden manhood. Set in "beautiful, ruined" western Pennsylvania, amid Eat n' Parks and Lick n' Putts, Tawni O'Dell's <i>Back Roads</i> follows Harley Altmyer as he walks a raging, self-conscious line between crime and innocence. Why is he being held by the authorities, and what's he so mad about? In the recent past, it's his mother, who murdered his father and went to jail for life. In the far past, it's Dad himself: an abusive, hopeless man. In the present, it's the responsibility for his three younger sisters, which makes him fantasize about smashing their faces in until they "spit up bloody macaroni and cheese." <p> But Harley still has a conscience--barely. He doesn't strike his sisters; he's been trying to protect them. The oldest is sassy Amber, 16, who's having sex on the living-room couch with townies who abuse her; next is frighteningly stoic 12-year-old Misty, with eyes "a glazed brown like a medicine bottle"; the youngest is adorable Jody, who at 6 pens to-do lists with items such as "PRAY FOR DADDYS SOWL." Overburdened with the practicalities of life, and the ever-mounting losses, Harley has started seeing his own words floating in the air in front of his face. "CLOSURE. TRUTH. MOST GUYS." </p><p> This first novel opens well. O'Dell does an impeccable job of making Harley both brutal and forgivable. Here, for instance, he retreats to his basement room: "I lay there until dawn, thinking about Dad, and feeling the same useless frustration I had felt the first time I had seen him piss on a sparkling white drift of pure new snow."</p><p> But that delicacy is soon lost, and <i>Back Roads</i> risks becoming an overabundant affair, pitched high, with a roller-coaster trajectory. Harley's anger metamorphoses into an almost bloodthirsty lust for his sexy, middle-aged neighbor, which stirs up myriad forbidden family secrets. Misty, it turns out, has been hiding something. Amber revolts. And even Jody's scribbles turn malevolent. While the writing is good throughout, the tension and plotting assume an unpleasant adolescent posture--bodice-ripping passion and mordant gloom combined. Nonetheless, O'Dell's assured and touching portrait of her protagonist emerges unscathed. You will likely remember luckless, fated Harley Altmyer long after his tsunamic tale has receded. And no matter what the judge decides, you will understand why this impoverished, angry young man was probably the most innocent one of all. <i>--Jean Lenihan</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>True Betrayals</h2><p>Kelsey Byden always believed that her mother was dead.

Mae prepares to be an angel in her school play, but will the arrival of her new baby sister spoil everything? The Pattersons have a load of wet cement unexpectedly delivered to their front doorstep. Carlos is itching for a new big bike, but Mom can't afford it. Still, his birthday is coming up... Samantha thinks Mrs. Dean next door is mean. But when Sam risks hurting her feelings, she feels miserable. These four stories--<i>Angel Mae</i>, <i>The Big Concrete Lorry</i>, <i>Wheels</i>, and <i>The Snow Lady</i>--are full of the everyday adversity and diversions familiar to anyone who has grown up in a closely knit neighborhood. Dozens of children from a bouquet of ethnic and cultural backgrounds tumble through the pages, weaving in and out of one another's lives in a friendly tangle of humanity. Well-loved British author and illustrator Shirley Hughes has a knack for treating ordinary lives and small moments as the important, fascinating times they really are. Her warm, affectionate tone and matching illustrations touch on real issues with a respectful light-handedness. Each simple tale captures the personalities and current drama of the characters, giving us a gentle glimpse of the tribulations that face all of us. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Ages 4^-7. Few picture books capture the everyday lives of families as well as Shirley Hughes' Trotter Street books, <i>Angel Mae</i>, <i>The Big Concrete Lorry</i>,<i> Wheels</i>, and <i>The Snow Lady</i>, which are here gathered into one beautiful volume. Each tale introduces people who all live on the same street, with some of the characters making cameo appearances in the other stories. The British-to-American glossary (<i>biscuits</i> means <i>cookies</i>, <i>flat</i> means <i>apartment</i>) facing the title page serves as a practical alternative to those annoying translations that mar so many English books condescendingly edited for American audiences. Though the texts appear to be uncut, a few of the illustrations have been omitted, slightly altered, or reduced in size to fit the new volume. Still, the fact that all four stories appear together makes this a good choice to add to collections, particularly for primary-grade children or even younger ones who want a <i>big</i> book. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)</h2><p>The final handcrafted installment by award-winning author Ann Rinaldi. "Whether they've covered the previous books or not, readers will enjoy this rip-roaring tale of adventure and suspense."-Kirkus<br><br>Amanda Videau had no idea what adventures she'd find on the journey North. But she never expected this... After witnessing a crime, she goes into hiding, disguising herself as a worker in her great-grandfather's textile mill. For the first time in her life, Amanda must work to survive. And that means experiencing the horrible working conditions of the mill firsthand.<br> Now, as Amanda fights for her newfound rights, she must also try to heal generations of deep Chelmsford family wounds. And that means facing the man behind the blue door--the man who tore apart the family quilt so many years ago.</p><p>Readers of the first two volumes of The Quilt Trilogy (A Stitch in Time, 1994, etc.) will delight in how Rinaldi (Keep Smiling Through, p. 535, etc.) brings all the pieces of her multigenerational saga together in this final work. Amanda Videau loves life on her family's South Carolina plantation, Yamassee. Then Grandmother Abigail sends her to Lowell, Mass., ostensibly to give Amanda a chance for adventure and independence. But Abigail's real hope is for Amanda to make peace with her estranged great-grandfather and to sell him on the idea of buying Yamassee cotton for his textile mill, the largest in New England. During Amanda's long steamship trip to the North, the ship blows up, killing nearly all its crew and passengers. Amanda, who saw the man who caused the explosion and knows that he will kill her, too, assumes the identity of a girl she met on the ship and flees. With the killer on her trail, no money, and a false identity, she finds employment in her great-grandfather's mill. Life as a mill girl is grim, and it isn't long before she protests, with the other workers, the abominable working conditions. Whether they've covered the previous books or not, readers will enjoy this rip-roaring tale of adventure and suspense; Amanda and all the other characters inhabit a revealing and credible historical milieu. (bibliography) (Fiction. 12+) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gr. 5^-8. Set in 1841, the third volume in Rinaldi's Quilt trilogy takes place more than 50 years after <i>A Stitch in Time</i> (1994) and about 30 years after <i>Broken Days</i> (1995). The fabric of the series is indeed a patchwork now. Familiar bits of family history and characters are side by side with new people, places, and events. And though a few aspects are jarring, for the third book in a trilogy, <i>Blue Door</i> stands alone very well. Amanda leaves her South Carolina plantation home to visit her great-grandfather in Massachusetts. On the steamship, she changes clothes with a girl she befriends. When the ship is wrecked, she is unable to prove her identity, so she continues to Lowell and takes a mill job, using her resources to work for better conditions and to find her way back to her family. The idea of setting each book in a different generation of the same family was ambitious. Although this device is not always successful, the trilogy tells involving stories of several strong female characters, shows people at different stages in their lives, and ties together three periods in America's past. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book: A Reproduction of the Original 1903 Edition</h2><p>A reproduction of their 1903 edition.

LeShan discusses the psychological and physiological effects of meditation, why meditation has these effects, and different types (or "paths") of meditation. To get the feel of it, he suggests starting with 15 minutes of breath counting--harder than it sounds. "The road of meditation is not an easy one," says LeShan. "The first shock of surprise comes when we realize how undisciplined our mind really is; how it refuses to do the bidding of our will." He gives detailed instructions for several meditations of different types and guidelines for choosing a program and a teacher. This is not a snappy "five minutes to perfect meditations" or a promise of "read this book, achieve instant peace." Rather, <i>How to Meditate</i> is a serious, thoughtful book. "In this most serious area--inner development--we are interested in evolution, which is stable, rather than revolution, which is not," says LeShan. You will see changes, he promises, but gradually. This is the new edition of the classic that has been teaching people to meditate since 1974. How wonderful that <i>How to Meditate</i> has been reissued, giving another generation the benefit of LeShan's work and guidance. <i>--Joan Price</i>This simple, straightforward yet powerful guide has ready helped hundreds of thousands of people reap the greatest rewards of meditation.

As a pretty and intelligent high school senior she is raped by three classmates, an attack instigated by Neal Patchett, the son of the most powerful man in Palmetto, S.C.

Even after she achieves professional success, her violent past will not allow her to enjoy healthy relationships with men--until she meets Dillon Burke, whom she hires to build the construction project in Palmetto that will spell financial ruin to Neal Patchett and his father. A heroine with a one-track mind can be tedious, but Brown's ( Mirror Image ) portrayal of Dillon as a well-rounded character in his own right adds depth to a fast-paced drama.

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.One<br> &nbsp;<br> AT THE SMALL bon voyage party at the Delmar Bay Yacht Club Kip and Selma had given Howard and Junie Prowt a little brass plaque to affix to one of the bulkheads of the HoJun. It read &#x201c;Oh Lord, thy sea is so vast and my boat is so small!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pull off the backing paper and press the gummed back of the plaque to any smooth clean surface.<br> Out in the middle of the Gulf Stream, at ten o&#x2019;clock on the bright morning of a windy and cloudless day in May, Howard Prowt, braced on the fly bridge of his thirty-four-foot Owens cruiser, knew the precise corner of the exact drawer where he had stowed the gift, and fought the absurd compulsion to go below and find it and peel it and stick it up.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stacks and tan cubes of Fort Lauderdale were below the horizon astern. He had plotted his course exactly as he had been taught in the Power Squadron classes, making the proper allowance for the northerly run of the Gulf Stream, and for standard deviation and compass deviation. He had computed his time of arrival at Bimini on the basis of 2300 rpm on his twin 150&#x2019;s. They had left Pier 66 at 8:30 and had passed the sea buoy at fourteen minutes before nine. At eleven minutes past noon the HoJun should reach the channel across the bar outside Bimini harbor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody told you how it would be. How it would feel. That was the trouble. They just said it could get a little dusty out there in the Stream. They didn&#x2019;t tell you about the strangeness, the alone-ness, the strange blue color and the power of it. There was an indifference about it, a lack of interest in you and your little boat. It changed the way everything looked and felt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Howard Prowt kept trying to scan the dials, to check oil pressure, temperature, rpm&#x2019;s&#x2014;and to check the performance of the automatic pilot against the compass, then would find himself staring, mind empty, braced for the next long lift of the hull, the teeter, the crash that would send water flashing white out to either side of the bow.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a good day to cross, he told himself. They build them for this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The HoJun had felt massive, ponderous, trustworthy in all the other places he had taken her since accepting delivery last November. She had looked large tied up at their backyard dock on Heron Bayou, sizeable in the yacht club boat basin. He had learned exactly how she would respond in all conditions of wind and tide, priding himself on that gentle touch on the throttles which would ease her so close to a dock that Junie, on the bow, could step ashore with the line and put the loop over a piling. There had been several short cruises, and one long one&#x2014;up to Stuart and through the lake and down the river to Fort Myers, then down the Gulf Coast to Marathon, and back home through Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay. He had taken her into some ugly chop in the Gulf, and had handled her in a tricky following sea. In his navigation he had always double-checked his course and had the pleasure of seeing the target markers, after long runs, loom out of the sea mist.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this was not the same. It made everything else seem like pretend. This was not the same sea they had watched two years ago from the recreation deck of the little Italian cruise ship which had taken them through the Caribbean, as far down as Cura�ao.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had stood at the rail and looked down onto that sea. This one lifted, rose, pushed itself up into great gleaming humps higher at times than his line of vision on the flying bridge, with one in ten foaming white against the incredible laundry-blueing blue as the wind toppled the tip of it. He tensed his stomach each time the HoJun seemed to hesitate before lifting to it. Atop those long silky bulges he could see for miles, see the random pattern of the waves breaking. Then she would tilt, smash&#x2014;making a jangling and thumping and clattering below, and a moment of noise, vibration and cavitation from the twin screws&#x2014;then glide down the far side of the hump to that point where, as she dug her nose deep and sent water slashing back against the pilot house windshield and the fiberglass which protected the fly bridge, he could not see more than fifty feet in any direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> He held fast against the motion, telling himself that this was not some deadly and dramatic shift in the weather pattern. It was just as the man at Pier 66 had predicted. &#x201c;Wind swinging very slow, Mr. Prowt, be almost direct out of the east in an hour, and a couple points north of east by the time you&#x2019;re clear of the Stream. Be a pretty fair swell, nothing you can&#x2019;t take okay; but once it&#x2019;s swiveled all the way out of the north, the five-day forecast says it&#x2019;ll be maybe three days before I&#x2019;d want to take it across. So you go now, you&#x2019;ll be fine. It won&#x2019;t have time to build the Stream up to a chop. I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;ll have a ten-knot breeze, freshening come evening. A pretty day to cross.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But nobody had described the absolute indifference of these swells, and the way they dwindled the HoJun to a silly little toy, and its owner to a foolish, childish fellow who had wanted to play captain.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had listened on the 100-watt ship-to-shore, heard nothing but nasal, casual, fishing-hunting talk on one channel, Miami marine placing phone calls on another, silence on the Coast Guard Emergency channel.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of these ponderous wallowing tumbles will tear a gas line loose and one engine will die and the spark from the other will ignite the loose gas in the bilge. Or a battery will shift and pull a cable loose and the engines will both die. Or some seam will give way in the hull, bringing in more water than the bilge pumps can handle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another painful abdominal cramp made him gasp and hunch himself. Great time for food poisoning. That lobster last night?<br> &nbsp;<br> And, Oh God, here comes the biggest one yet!<br> &nbsp;<br> She lifted up and up, toppled over the crest with an uneasy corkscrewing motion, the cavitation lasting longer, glided down the blue hill and smashed her bow deep enough to send solid water streaming back along the side decks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Exactly what the hell am I doing out here?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think, honey, that next May we&#x2019;ll cruise the Bahamas. Get Kip and Selma to go along. Take a whole month pooting around. Maybe go over as far as Eleuthera. How about it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When you have enough boat to get to the Bahamas, and when you live so close, and when maybe next year they&#x2019;ll make you Fleet Captain of the Delmar Bay Yacht Club, then you go. Or they&#x2019;ll think you incompetent or timid.<br> &nbsp;<br> So I&#x2019;m timid, he thought. Outboards they bring over here. They race from Miami to Nassau when the seas are higher. Any boat has a lot of safety factor, and this one was new six months ago. But I came out past that sea buoy feeling like Horatio Hornblower, and right now I am one scared, retired wholesale grocer from Moline out in the middle of all this tumbling blue indifference that doesn&#x2019;t care whether I sink, blow up or make it across.<br> &nbsp;<br> Always wanted a cruiser.<br> &nbsp;<br> God, just get me there!<br> &nbsp;<br> Junie, fighting for balance, clutched at his arm, startling him. She tottered away with a jolly whoop of dismay, grabbed at the pilot seat, settled into it and grinned at him. Her grin was uncharacteristically broad, her gray eyes not properly focused, her sandy-blonde hair matted damp with sea water, her color so bleached under her deep tan it gave her flesh an odd saffron tone. Above her denim halter her skin had a plucked-chicken look, so pronounced were the goose pimples.<br> &nbsp;<br> He knew that she was both nauseated and terrified, and trying with a touching gallantry not to show either. But terror had to be stronger than the nausea, because she hated the increased swing and dip of the flying bridge, avoiding it except when it was dead calm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Neither of us belong here, he thought. It&#x2019;s all some kind of pretend. She&#x2019;s a fifty-eight-year-old housewife and mother from Moline, and since we moved down here she&#x2019;s dieted and exercised and trimmed herself down, and baked herself brown, turned from gray to blonde, wears these play clothes, even talks in ways which would puzzle the placid Moline matron of two years ago. But it is all pretend for both of us&#x2014;damn fools out of a yachting magazine ad, tricked finally into playing our game out here where all of a sudden it&#x2019;s all turned real.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Getting rougher, darling?&#x201d; she called over the sound of wind and sea and engines.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Staying about the same. You feel better?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A little.&#x201d; The fixed smile stayed in place, even when she stared ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Full fuel tanks, he thought. Full water tanks. And that damned couple of tons of provisions we carried aboard and stowed. Riding lower in the water than she ever has, and we have to get into this.<br> &nbsp;<br> He made a businesslike routine of reading all the gauges, wearing his seamanship frown.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something wrong?&#x201d; she called, the smile gone, her mouth pinching tight, bloodless lips sucked in, looking suddenly like an old, old woman garbed for some vulgar ingenue role.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not a damn thing wrong!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to shout at me, Howard. I mean&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t understand the engines and things. And it just seems to get&#x2014;worse and worse.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He patted her on the shoulder. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine. Really fine.&#x201d;</p><h2>Room 23</h2><p>ROOM 23 depicts a year in the life of a private penthouse suite in a hotel in Beverly Hills, California. The year is 2008.

Anne taught Linda how to write, how to see, how to imagine; and only Linda could have written a book that captures so vividly the intimate details and lingering emotions of their lives together. <b>Searching for Mercy Street</b> speaks to everyone who admires Anne Sexton and to every daughter or son who knows the pain of an imperfect childhood.In a dramatic memoir, Sexton (Private Acts, 1991, etc.) offers her account of life with suicidal poet Anne Sexton. This highly personal account complements Diane Middlebrook's 1991 biography of Anne Sexton, and even textual overlaps can be intriguing. For example, Middlebrook places one of Anne's suicide attempts near Linda's Harvard dormitory room but across from the office of Barbara Schwartz, then Anne's therapist. Here Linda simply omits Schwartz from the scene, thus highlighting her own importance to the story. One of Linda's primary themes is in fact her attempt to extricate herself from her mother's dependence on her. The childhood scenes Linda paints (including seeing her mother masturbate) most often terrify her and her younger sister, Joy. Anne's depression and instability make a poor match for her husband's volatility: She taunts him, and he beats her as the children look on. Writing with the immediacy of the present tense, Linda notes than when Anne spanks her, ``she never counts. She just does it till she isn't angry anymore.... I hate her. I hate me.'' Linda responds to such chaos by imposing order in her own small ways, eating precisely one piece of Halloween candy each day or tidying the house her mother ignores while she writes. Linda even tries to take care of her mother, but it is not until she reaches high school that they become friends: ``At last she seemed to like me.'' As Linda matures, she learns about writing, particularly from Anne and her friend Maxine Kumin, but she also struggles to free herself of her mother. Even after Anne's suicide, Linda finds her life linked to her mother's, most directly in her work as literary executor, but most disturbingly in her own struggle against depression and her battles to maintain her equilibrium when dealing with her own children. In deceptively fluid prose, Linda explores her complex relationship to her mother and strips raw the nerves of a troubled family.

Still the most comprehensive and authoritative book on the subject, this new edition of Effective Succession Planning presents strategies for creating a complete, systematic succession planning program. Updated and expanded to reflect the latest trends and best practices in succession management, the book contains 20 per cent new material, including chapters on recruitment and retention as part of succession planning, as well as updated references and research. The book also includes a CD-Rom filled with worksheets, assessment tools, and training guides...everything readers need to help lead their organizations into the future.</p><p>If you're looking for a quick, easy, and fun guide to constantly cultivating from within your organization the talent to move up and fill positions left behind by others, don't look here. Written by a human resources expert who teaches at Penn State, <i>Effective Succession Planning</i> must surely be one of the driest books ever written on this topic, from its aggressively unsexy title and jacket to its college-textbook format and arsenal of supplementary checklists, flowcharts, and exercises. <p> Having said that, it's also probably one of the most thorough books on the topic (and a fine complement to <i>The Leadership Pipeline</i>), incorporating methodical and meticulous guidelines to preparing for and quickly filling crucial vacancies at all levels of the organization, from top management to sales, administrative, technical, and production positions. Not only does it lay out a plan for instituting a long-term succession planning program that includes everything from early action steps to ongoing evaluation and revision, it also shows how to develop, monitor, and evaluate talent and skills in individual employees in order to promote effectively from within (although it acknowledges that sometimes the best choices come from outside, and offers key steps for optimizing the outside-search process as well). </p><p> Everything is covered here, from the legal implications of hiring and firing and online and high-tech resources to major trends that will affect succession planning in the years ahead.

William Wei traces to the late 1960s the initial genesis of an Asian American identity, culture, and activism through which members of this pan-Asian group could assert their right to belong to and be respected as responsible members of this society. Although its antecedents were the civil rights and Black Power movements, the Asian American Movement actually resulted from the protests against the Vietnam War and the emergence of a generation of college-aged Chinese and Japanese Americans. In this definitive study of the Asian American Movement, Wei fills an important gap in our knowledge of ethnic social movements and the struggle to achieve American cultural democracy. Lacking a nationally known leader but confronted by many shared issues and concerns, the Asian American Movement was essentially a middle-class reform effort to achieve racial equality, social justice, and political empowerment. It focused on ethnic solidarity and self-empowerment through political activism, educational and community development, and cultural expressions. While the Movement was most visible on the West Coast, notably at the Third World Strike at San Francisco State College in 1968, it became a vital force simultaneously on campuses and in Asian American communities throughout the country. Wei evaluates the Movement&#39;s effort to develop a unique but cohesive ethnic identity and the internal struggles between reformist and revolutionary approaches to social change. He analyzes the Asian American women&#39;s movement, the alternative press, Asian American studies programs, community-based organizations, andMaoist sects. His study concludes with an examination of Asian American involvement in electoral politics and the quest for political empowerment. Interviews with many of the key participants in the Movement and photographs of Asian American demonstrations and events enhance Wei</p><p><p>Active for more than two decades, the Asian American movement began a middle-class reform effort to achieve racial equality, social justice, and political empowerment.

This is low, directed to me, but others hear it. A little comic relief. There&#x2019;s a titter of laughter from behind us, up on the risers. Johnston and the other guard don&#x2019;t laugh.</p><p>Dreyers whispers, lower now, under his breath, to me only. &#x201c;Pretty soon they&#x2019;ll pop the question.&#x201d;</p><p>I look at him.</p><p>&#x201c;For $64,000&#x2014;how long can you hold your breath?&#x2019; He gives me a little sideways wink. I can hear some giggling on the other side of Dreyers. Another cop, one of his buddies.</p><p>Bad taste, I think. But as I study the scene, he&#x2019;s right. Now this room with its cupola-like top, lit on the inside like some Macy&#x2019;s store window, does not resemble anything so much as one of the glittering, cheesy booths from a sixties TV quiz show.</p><p>A lone guard enters the room through a door on the other side of the chamber. Muffled cries, intonations of a desperate low moan are clearly audible as the door is closed.</p><p>Now each calculated procedure is a step closer to death for the man waiting on the other side of that door. In quick, measured movements the guard lowers two sets of green venetian blinds, covering windows on the other side of the chamber. These will mask the execution team as they open the valves and throw the lever to release the lethal gas.</p><p>Then I see them, the size of two softballs. Granules of sodium cyanide, like fine baking powder, a pound each, have been tied and molded into a round form. They are held in two pieces of cheesecloth and fastened to a device over the vat under each chair. These deadly chemical balls hang tenuously by wire from two curved metal arms. When the lever is thrown these arms will drop, the cyanide falling into the pots of sulfuric acid and water. For safety the two vats are now empty.</p><p>Sally Ryan&#x2019;s father is here, a decade older, grayer, the lines of his face more deeply etched than I remember. He stands apart from the rest of us, as if he&#x2019;s on a different mission, some ancient and sacred vendetta bred of human instinct. The memory of a defiled and murdered child is long.</p><p>I asked Ryan about the parents of the other girl, Linda Maldinado. &#x201c;Divorced,&#x201d; he said, as if this explained their absence. What he meant was, destroyed&#x2014;ravaged by a grieving they could not conclude while this thing remained open, incomplete. It&#x2019;s the first I&#x2019;ve seen of either family since the trial, when Ryan and the more aggressive Mrs. Maldinado hovered with me in hallways, demanding assurance that justice wouldn&#x2019;t be stillborn. Ryan eyes me now with a cynicism that is palpable, an abiding bitterness that the journey has taken this long.</p><p>My own presence here is as a favor to Sam Jennings, the DA now out of office with whom I prosecuted Danley. Jennings is sick, too ill to make this appointment, perhaps too close to death himself to stare it squarely in the eye.</p><p>Gale Haight is here. I nodded to him as we boarded the van. He didn&#x2019;t return the gesture. A normally affable man two years my senior in law school, Haight cannot bring himself to even a grudging greeting on this day. He carries a heavy burden, having defended Danley at trial.</p><p>There are a few cops here, represented because the law says they must be. The others, ten men and two women, I suspect are political favorites of the governor or the director of corrections, official guests for this grim task.</p><p>I stand next to Jim Dreyers, now retired from the sheriff&#x2019;s department. Dreyers had tracked Brian Danley to a girlfriend&#x2019;s apartment after the killings. Backed up by the SWAT team, he&#x2019;d made the arrest and led Danley, with hands cuffed behind his back, to a squad car. The suspect spat at cameras all the way there; a large green lugi caught in mid-flight centered the frame of one of the shots. It made the cover of <i>Newsweek,</i> a special crime edition.</p><p>Since the conviction, Danley&#x2019;s been handled by skilled appellate attorneys, people who&#x2019;ve delayed this date six times in seven years. Whenever cameras are made available now, Danley is the picture of polite reserve. A bleeding-heart piece in the bar association&#x2019;s house organ a year ago pictured him the circumspect image of justice denied. He is, if the story is to be believed, the pitiable victim of fetal-alcohol syndrome. An army of shrinks is now assembled to attest to this malady. It&#x2019;s the latest in an endless series of social ills raised to excuse his crime, or at a minimum to avoid its punishment. These news articles are well placed for maximum effect. They don&#x2019;t play in the magazines &#x201c;for inquiring minds.&#x201d; Instead Danley&#x2019;s lawyers shoot for a more lofty readership, fed into publications an appellate judge might read in an idle hour.</p><p>The chamber door, something from a vintage submarine, is open facing the other side.</p><p>Three people were already in the room when we arrived, an older woman and two clergymen. One of them comforts the woman, an arm around her shoulder. She, I assume, is family.</p><p>Confronting him daily through four months of trial seven years ago, I wonder whether Danley will show the same sand now. Then, he&#x2019;d been hard. Unremitting.</p><p>He was his own lawyer&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Through weeks of trial endless versions of a smug expression occupied his face. He smiled through half-a-day of horrors&#x2014;testimony by the medical examiner that caused one juror to lose her breakfast. Against the advice of his own attorney he took the stand, denying all association with the crime, this in utter contradiction to a sea of physical evidence that included his own fingerprints at the scene. Danley was at some loss to explain how they&#x2019;d become superimposed in the blood of his two victims.</p><p>After conviction, in the penalty phase, to an astonished jury which was only a little less dazed than his own lawyer, Danley admitted that he&#x2019;d done it. His version of throwing himself on the mercy of the jury, it seems, was a public survey of the crimes in mind-wrenching detail.</p><p>I remember the vivid photos of Sally Ryan and the Maldinado girl after they had been raped and sodomized. These shots were dominated by the grotesque rust hues of congealed blood&#x2014;their throats sliced with the precision of a scalpel. Danley used the razor-sharp hooked blade of a linoleum knife. &#x201c;A tool of the trade,&#x201d; he called it. This particular knife hadn&#x2019;t seen linoleum in years. He kept it for special occasions. It was once used to carve a deep letter &#x201c;A,&#x201d; to the bone, in his wife&#x2019;s right cheek. Danley, after a little too much to drink, found himself fantasizing about marital infidelities on the part of his common-law wife, a woman he hadn&#x2019;t seen in a year. Some bar-babbling luminary, it seems, had given him a more lurid than literal review of <i>The Scarlet Letter.</i> I steel myself with the thought that Brian Danley is a creature the world is well rid of.</p><p>I check my watch. It&#x2019;s now one minute past the appointed hour. There are noises on the other side of the chamber. The agonized wailing of a man, his words, except for one, unintelligible. The repetition of a single syllable grows louder: &#x201c;No-o-o-o...&#x201d;</p><p>Two stone-faced guards enter from the other side. Behind them, struggling feebly, Brian Trevor Danley is unrecognizable to me. Forty pounds lighter than at any time during the trial, he is a ghost. The swagger and bravado are gone. His knees are bent, feet dragging. He&#x2019;s carried under each arm by two guards, bulls who could snap him like a twig should he resist. Danley&#x2019;s hands are manacled in front. His eyes are wild, haunted, searching as if to devour every image left to them in the seconds that remain. He searches the faces beyond the glass without apparent recognition as his stockinged feet are dragged over the threshold into the chamber. As he&#x2019;s turned and pushed down into the chair, he sees her. His eyes light up.</p><p>&#x201c;Bampa. Bampa.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;s imploring the woman with the two clergymen. Her arms are extended, as if she could reach out and grab him.</p><p>I nudge Dreyers and motion with my head toward the woman.</p><p>&#x201c;His aunt. Bampa&#x2019;s the name he gave her as a kid.&#x201d; Dreyers shrugs his shoulders as if to say &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame me.&#x201d;</p><p>Danley&#x2019;s wearing a pressed blue work shirt, the kind made here by inmates, open at the neck, and prison denim pants. The fact that he&#x2019;s shoeless says reams about this journey. From the front of his shirt protrudes a small black tube. This is part of the stethoscope which will be connected to a device in the wall. From this a physician will determine the instant of death.</p><p>In quick, efficient motions, three of the officers strap him into the metal chair. Two-inch web straps, two around each arm, two around the chest and abdomen, hold him erect and still. The other guard straps his legs tightly to the chair. They are finished in less than a minute. Three of the guards leave. The last hooks up the stethoscope, then gives Danley a quick pat on the knee and says something to him. I can&#x2019;t hear the words, but I read his lips. &#x201c;When you hear the gas, breathe deeply.&#x201d;</p><p>Now Danley is terror-stricken, beyond comprehension, his head whipping wildly from side to side. His moan is constant, a low groan from the tiny room, a tortured mantra.</p><p>The last guard ducks backward out of the chamber, and the door is closed and sealed from the outside.

All I know is that ever since I got it, it&#x2019;s been a huge influenceon me. <i>Idols</i> is one of the best photographic books I&#x2019;ve ever seen. It was published in 1973 and is a collection of studio portraits of trannies, gender-benders, and just generally awesome looking people in New York City. It&#x2019;s an incredible time capsule. There are Warhol people, like Taylor Mead and Holly Woodlawn, and members of the San Francisco-based psychedelic drag queen performance troupe the Cockettes. There&#x2019;s a photo of the artist Al Hansen, (a.k.a. Beck&#x2019;s grandfather), covered in silvery paint and dressed up like some kind of Roman soldier, and an unrecognizable, teenage Harvey Fierstein, looking like a young, pretty Jewish lady (well, almost). Most important, these people all had the best style. The greatest fashion always originates with drag queens. The outfit you&#x2019;re wearing today was probably invented by a drag queen ten years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ryan McGinley, <i>Vice</i> Magazine, New York City 2010<br><br><i><b>Idols</b></i>, an authentic compendium of 1970s&#x2019; New York style and attitude, and a confirmed masterpiece, began with an awestruck Larrain visiting Max&#x2019;s Kansas City in the explosively liberating early years of the gay rights movement, and befriending Taylor Meade and John Noble. Once they came to be photographed, the rest followed. <b><i>Idols</i></b> represents a generation of New York&#x2019;s most talented, outrageous, glamorous, and mostly gay personalities, after spending hours applying original makeup and costumes to pose for Gilles in his now legendary SoHo studio.</p><p><b>Gilles Larrain </b>was born in Da Lat, Vietnam in 1938 to a diplomat/painter father and a pianist/painter mother.

Gilles attended the Lyc�e Fran�ais in New York and he later attended L&#x2019;Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris where he studied architecture and city planning. A trip to Oaxaca, Mexico in 1963 to document the sites of Monte Alban and Mitla opened the door to a burgeoning love of photography. Gilles moved back to New York City in 1965 and settled into his artistic life, mixing sculpture, inflatable structures, neon, painting, and photography.

His other novels include&nbsp;<i>Manifesto For the Dead</i>, an evocative look at the latter days of pulp writer Jim Thompson.</p>In Edgar-nominee Stansberry's compelling and incredibly dark modern noir shocker, forensic psychologist Jake Danser alternates between his day job&#x2014;interviewing murder suspects then testifying to their culpability&#x2014;and bedding as many women as possible without letting his beautiful wife catch on. When one of his mistresses ends up dead, the focus turns on Danser, and a weighty knot of a psychological puzzle begins to slowly unravel. Danser is a fascinating narrator because he's a shifty one, telling his story in small, measured bits ("it is true, there are a few things I haven't mentioned here about Angela and myself," he says nearly halfway into the story); the things going on in the world outside him are almost of secondary interest to what is going on inside his head. While the Hard Case series consciously strives for a pulp feel with retro artwork and packaging, the writing itself is infused with a modern sensibility&#x2014;after all, Philip Marlowe never said anything like "for a minute I was a man within the void, and it was the void that imagined me." Stansberry pours on the blood and guts in places, so much so that readers may want to take a shower upon finishing, but lovers of industrial strength neo-noir will savor the book's thoroughly seamy atmosphere. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slavery is a broader examination of the subject as it covers various civilizations from ancient Greece and Pre-Columbian societies to the pre-Civil War United States.

In 2016, the acclaimed memoirist Brian Castner retraced Mackenzie's route by canoe in a grueling journey -- and discovered the Passage he could not find.</strong></p> <p><em>Disappointment River</em> is a dual historical narrative and travel memoir that at once transports readers back to the heroic age of North American exploration and places them in a still rugged but increasingly fragile Arctic wilderness in the process of profound alteration by the dual forces of globalization and climate change. Fourteen years before Lewis and Clark, Mackenzie set off to cross the continent of North America with a team of voyageurs and Chipewyan guides, to find a trade route to the riches of the East. What he found was a river that he named "Disappointment." Mackenzie died thinking he had failed. He was wrong.<br>In this book, Brian Castner not only retells the story of Mackenzie's epic voyages in vivid prose, he personally retraces his travels, battling exhaustion, exposure, mosquitoes, white water rapids and the threat of bears. He transports readers to a world rarely glimpsed in the media, of tar sands, thawing permafrost, remote indigenous villages and, at the end, a wide open Arctic Ocean that could become a far-northern Mississippi of barges and pipelines and oil money.</p></p><p>Brian Castner is a former Explosive Ordnance Disposal officer who received a Bronze Star for his service in the Iraq War.

Like sailors putting into port or whalers tying up ships in a gam, voyageurs thirsted for the <i>rendezvous </i>with a pent-up intensity bordering on lust: part reunion, part respite, part drunken revelry, the highlight of a voyageur's year.<br><br>They descended upon the annual conclave from every direction. Great Lakes traders from Fort Michilimackinac and the Mississippi basin. <i>Mangeurs de lard</i>, the lowliest pork eaters, from the east, carrying in their massive birch-bark canoes a season&#x2019;s worth of gunpowder and casked rum. And of greatest esteem, the vaunted <i>hommes du nord</i>, the men who had survived the far interior and lived to tell about it. Half-starved, frostbitten, weary; to reach the <i>rendezvous</i>, some had paddled for two or three months, over a thousand miles, from the Slave River, �le-�-la-Crosse, the Old Establishment, through the Rapids of the Drowned and the <i>Rivi�re Maligne</i>.<br><br>These men were human draft horses, known for their bravery, their drinking, their song, their whoring, their cheer, but most of all for their work ethic. For the fur-trading empire of Montreal was powered by the labor of illiterate farm boys from Quebec. At the <i>rendezvous</i>, the <i>hommes du nord </i>exchanged tens of thousands of beaver skins for the <i>mangeurs du lard&#x2019;s </i>iron trade goods from London, a swap permitted by the bitter snow-driven land only once a year.<br><br>Voyageurs tended to be short&#x2014;there was almost nowhere to put one&#x2019;s feet in a canoe packed to the gunnel with supplies&#x2014;but powerful, to work all day and carry heavy <i>pi�ces </i>on dangerous portages. &#x201c;If he shall stop growing at about five feet four inches, and be gifted with a good voice, and lungs that never tire, he is considered having been born under a good star,&#x201d; said one fur trader of the time.<br><br>A good voice, for they sang all day. They sang to synchronize their strokes. They sang to pass the time between smoked pipes. They sang to stay awake. The songs were filthy, bawdy versions of old religious hymns and children&#x2019;s rhymes with popular melodies. Songs of beautiful women, and dances, and work, and crows picking at the flesh of corpses butchered in an Iroquois raid.<br><i>Qui sont de bons enfants;</i><br><br><i>Ah!

For one month each summer, Grand Portage hosted both the headquarters of an international commercial empire and the rowdiest party in a thousand miles. Each was the reflection of the other, could not exist without the other. The facilities at Grand Portage were all related to commerce: warehouses, stables, forges, canoe depots. In truth, the fort constituted only a quasi-town. A communal garden but no church, a watchtower but no government&#x2019;s soldiers, a factory for a single industry, the hub of every spoke, the gangway to the north.<br><br>Via paddle and portage trail, the <i>rendezvous </i>appeared in the distant wilderness like a tiny gnat on a horse&#x2019;s rump. A palisade fence, shingled roofs, fields of white tents, hundreds of canoes at the fort. All the terms of trade were martial: Groups of canoes were a brigade, and they marched across the water. The Indians were kept on the outside of the picket, in teepees layered with bark. &#x201c;Fence builders,&#x201d; the Ojibwa called the whites. They meant it as a pejorative.<br><br>The night before they reached Grand Portage, the voyageurs shaved, washed their hair, changed into clean white shirts saved for the occasion. All year, when laboring in the stacked boreal forest, wading through sucking muskeg, dodging Sioux war parties, curled for warmth with their Cree wives, they might dress in rags, filthy and emaciated. But when they arrived at the <i>rendezvous</i>, they intended to make an entrance, deep in song.<br><br>And waiting for them, upon disembarkation, a <i>regale</i>, a feast: a four-pound loaf of bread fresh out of the hot brick oven, half a pound of butter, and a bottle of rum; molasses-soaked Brazilian twist tobacco too, and roasts of freshly slaughtered hogs. For those few weeks, the northmen had nothing to do but talk and drink and screw and fight. While sober, they exchanged family news&#x2014;who died, who was born, who was now married, all back in Quebec&#x2014;and found clerks to read them long out-of-date newspapers. Then they hit the rum, and in service of their festivities some spent a year&#x2019;s worth of wages or went into debt, and not a few signed back on for another winter&#x2014;or two, or three&#x2014;based upon the depths of those debts. And then, a fortnight later, they headed back north.<br><br>The employer of all these voyageurs was a new business venture known as the North West Company. More a cartel than a proper corporation with a sole executive, the partnership was designed as a loose confederation of semiautonomous fur traders who pooled their resources for mutual benefit while always reserving the right to resume competition in the future. Borrowing the voyageurs&#x2019; French, the shareholders called themselves <i>bourgeois</i>.<br><br>The ratio of voyageurs to invested partners was a hundred to one, and only a few dozen bourgeois gathered in the main lodge each day. While the men caroused, their masters feasted in the style of the European gentlemen they aspired to be. All the partners and clerks and trusted interpreters gathered together for a lavish midday meal: bread, pork, beef, hams, venison, butter, peas, corn, potatoes, tea, spirits, wine, and plenty of milk from cows quartered at the fort. The growing season was so short they ate root vegetables from the year prior, but no one seemed to mind. All of the gentlemen&#x2019;s pants were equipped with gussets so they could be cinched up in winter but, equally important, let out in summer.<br><br>But they did more than eat. Only at the <i>rendezvous </i>did so many <i>bourgeois </i>meet in one place. The northern agents and Montreal investors had business to discuss, and it was for that reason that Alexander and Roderic Mackenzie had traveled so far that summer.<br><br>Alexander and Roderic were cousins, Scottish refugees largely alone in the world but for each other. Both were in their late twenties and up-and-comers, finding their way in the fiercely competitive trade. Their similarities were limited to age and acumen alone, though. Alexander was the more ambitious, energetic, direct. His partners thought him &#x201c;blond, strong and well built.&#x201d; Where Alexander was fair and square-jawed, Roderic was moon-faced, fleshy, with flat dark hair. The only family feature they shared was a knowing smile.<br><br>Alexander had been in the trade several years longer than Roderic and by hard work and good timing had already been named a partner of the North West Company, the most junior member of that exclusive fraternity. Meanwhile, Roderic was still laboring as a clerk, a bookkeeping apprentice, and was wondering if his chance would ever come. But Alexander needed Roderic, if he was going to seize the opportunity that lay before him that summer.<br><br>The fur trade was a global business, and multicultural, reliant on London countinghouses, led by Scots and Americans, utilizing French labor, trading with Indians in a vast wilderness, and shipping around the world. Which caused the <i>bourgeois </i>of the North West Company endless problems.<br><br>The mechanics of their trade were slow. Ships and canoes moved only a hundred miles a day. Payment from Europe could take years, and so their capital was perpetually at risk; one bad season would drown them in their debt. The most valuable beaver furs lay ever more to the north and west, so their clerks and voyageurs pushed farther inland every year. And to top it all off, recent reports said that sea otters&#x2014;and, more important, Indians willing to trade their pelts&#x2014;were crawling all over the Pacific coast, a place to which they had no access.<br><br>For all those reasons and more, at that <i>rendezvous </i>in the summer of 1788, the Northwest Passage was on the agenda. Alexander Mackenzie was the one who put it there, because with his cousin&#x2019;s help he intended to persuade his partners to send him in search of it, a voyage that would make his fortune.<br><br>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<br><br>From the moment Christopher Columbus realized that he had stumbled upon a new continent, rather than China, there was always a tension, among European explorers, between exploiting the riches of the New World and finding a route around it.<br><br>Yes, this new land was full of tobacco and furs and gold. But it was also in the way. European markets clamored for tea, spices, blue-and-white porcelain dinner settings, silk stockings. For every businessman who sought to strip the New World of resources, another just wanted to get on to the real market in China; in 1497, even as Spain colonized the West Indies, John Cabot, an Italian sailing under an English charter, tried to find a northwest passage around America. The continent had only been known to Europeans for five years, and they were already trying to bypass it. Cabot failed, bumping into Newfoundland instead.<br><br>In this Golden Age of Discovery, nothing was actually discovered. White humans stepped no place in North America that other human feet had not already trodden. But these Europeans did leave a mark, because they did two things that no one else had. They mapped the lands, and they told the rest of the world about them.<br><br>To the south, few rivers promised passage through the continent. John Smith, after founding Jamestown in 1607, tried to find the Pacific by sailing up the Chickahominy and the Potomac, but these rivers quickly dried up at the Endless Mountains of the Appalachians. In 1609, Henry Hudson&#x2019;s river option petered out, so he went to the north and gave his name to the frozen bay where he died in 1611, set adrift in a dingy by his mutinous and starving crew. Between Labrador and Greenland lie many gulfs, bays, and straits that tease passage to the Pacific, and all are now named for the naval officers&#x2014;Frobisher, Davis, Baffin&#x2014;who tried and failed to transit them in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. All were turned aside by pack ice. For practical purposes, the matter appeared to be settled. These most northerly reaches were perpetually encrusted in ice, and ever would be, so there could be no northwest passage above the Arctic Circle.<br><br>Therefore, between Florida and the northern cold, only one option remained: the St. Lawrence River. It was an obvious choice. The mouth of the waterway serves as a giant funnel, drawing in all ships over a four-hundred-mile swath; even in its relative narrows, the river forms a grand natural gateway, sheer cliffs on either side, a portal through which you could march all the world&#x2019;s armies. Only the St. Lawrence breached the Endless Mountains, ran free from ice most of the year, and accessed the heart of the continent. Many leading cartographers believed it would prove to be one end of an interior Northwest Passage.<br><br>That such a Northwest Passage should exist at all was one of inescapable logic. Since Aristotle, geographers subscribed to a philosophy of a balanced earth, in both weight and function. That the same amount of land must appear in the northern hemisphere as the southern, that features present in one area would be mirrored in all others, was axiomatic. This theory had already produced results; the long-sought <i>terra australis</i>, a large continent in the south required to balance Europe and Asia in the north, was found by Dutch sailors in the South Pacific in the seventeenth century. So too, if a southern passage existed around South America at <i>tierra del fuego</i>, a corresponding waterway must exist in the north.<br><br>And the North West Company intended to find it, because in the fur trade the competing goals of continental exploitation and bisection were finally united in one inescapable business imperative.<br><br>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><h2>Conceived Without Sin</h2><p>a book about life and faith, struggles and strenght.</p><p></p><h2>Citroen Traction Avant</h2><p>Citroen&#39;s Traction Avant was the world&#39;s most advanced family car at its launch in 1934, and in the course of its 23-year life it became a national emblem for the French.

When she learns about avalanches that bury people without warning, she challenges herself: ''What if I teach a dog to save lives?'' This quest propels her to train the best possible search dog, vowing to never leave anyone behind. </p> <p> With no clue how to care for a houseplant, let alone a dog, she chooses a five-week-old Labrador retriever, Tasha. With the face of a baby bear and the temperament of an NFL linebacker, Tasha constantly tests Susan's determination to transform her into a rescue dog. Susan and Tasha jockey for alpha position as they pursue certification in avalanche, water, and wilderness recovery. Susan eventually learns to truly communicate with Tasha by seeing the world through her dog's nose. </p> <p> As the first female team in a male-dominated search-and-rescue community, they face resistance at every turn. They won't get paid even a bag of kibble for their efforts, yet they launch dozens of missions to rescue the missing or recover the remains of victims of nature and crime. </p> <p> Training with Tasha in the field to find, recover, and rescue the lost became Susan's passion. But it was also her circumstance -- she was in many ways as lost as anyone she ever pulled out of an avalanche or found huddled in the woods. ''Lostness'' doesn't only apply to losing the trail. People can get lost in a relationship, a business, or a life. Susan was convinced that only happened to other people, until Tasha and a life in the mountains taught her otherwise. </p></p><p><p> <b>Susan Purvis</b>, owner of Crested Butte Outdoors International, has taught wilderness medicine to everyone from the Secret Service to Sherpa guides in Nepal.

In her seeming Quixotic quest to train an avalanche dog and join the professional ski patrol at Crested Butte, she blissfully ignores the long-standing barriers to women and change in the established annals of mountain history. To her credit, she tilts at windmills, wins entry and the grudging respect of the windmills.

She has created an inspiring and approachable selection of food for occasions that range from the festive feasts to the most intimate meal for two, all built around complete menu plans. Each menu has at least four recipes, and is designed to help us plan satisfying and delicious meat-free meals. Her Bonfire Party menu includes One Pot Chilli and Toffee Caramel Apple Wedges; her Middle-Eastern Feast includes Falafels and Nutty Baklava; and Kids Tea has Alphabet Soup and Mac 'n' Cheese.<br><br>With stunning photography &#x2013; including family pictures from both past and present &#x2013; At My Table is about food that brings people together, food that we share with those we love and becomes part of our memories.</p><p>Mary McCartney is an acclaimed photographer who has shot editorial and ad campaigns around the world for clients such as <i>Harper&#x2019;s, Vanity Fair, </i>Mandarin Oriental<i>, </i>Adidas<i>, </i>and Boucheron. The eldest daughter of Paul and Linda, and sister to creative siblings Stella and James, Mary worked with her mother on a number of vegetarian cookbooks, and has been a consultant, for over a decade, for Linda McCartney Foods (lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk), a British brand specializing in meat-free dishes, created in 1991 by Linda McCartney. Mary McCartney published <i>Food</i> with Sterling Epicure in 2013."Mary McCartney gets it. She gets that the best food is always personal, always eaten with family and friends, always made simply from seasonal, fresh ingredients, and that memory and hope always sit side by side at the table too. And because she has such a sharp, idiosyncratic eye, all this is caught and celebrated with her stunning photographs." Monty Don "Mary's love of vegetables is infectious! This book is packed full of vibrant, happy and easy-to-master recipes, each and every one delicious. But there is also an important issue at stake here and that is the health of this planet - we must all eat less meat in order to ensure its survival. This book proves more than anything that this needn't be a hardship but rather a joy!" Skye Gyngell "There is definitely a recipe in here to suit any occasion. From tostadas deluxe and pumpkin and chilli soup to buckwheat pancakes and black bean burgers you will never be stuck for a tasty and nutritious vegetarian meal" Mummy Pages "Makes entertaining easy, whatever the occasion" Town &amp; Country "The recipes are family pleasers" Waitrose Weekend</p><h2>Destiny Cards: Your Birth Card &amp; What It Reveals About Your Past, Present &amp; Future</h2><p>Using just your birthdate, Destiny Cards will reveal your future and even explain your past. Is this a good year for your love life? What are your best years for marriage? Why did you change jobs last year? When are you due to come into some money? What obstacles stand in the way of your success and how can you avoid them? Find the answers to these questions and more within the cards of your destiny! <p>Through a revolutionary system of fortune telling, Destiny Cards will show you predictions about your future that are startlingly accurate and insightful. Covering finances, career, travel, health and relationships, this book will amaze you with detailed descriptions of the events in your life and help you use this information to change your life for the better. </p><p>An in-depth, yet surprisingly simple fortune telling system, Destiny Cards is based on what we know today as an ordinary deck of playing cards combined with a science used by ancient Egyptians. Offering a wealth of tantalizing secrets and profound insights, Destiny Cards is your key to unlocking the mysteries of your past, present and future.</p></p><p>Ten years ago, Robert Camp discovered an ancient method of determining people&#39;s destinies. He has written five books revealing the secrets of the forecasting science featured in Destiny Cards. He also does personal readings for well-known celebrities, teaches seminars and frequently appears on television and radio talk shows. His most recent book, Love Cards, is also published by Sourcebooks.from the Introduction <p>What you are about to learn is part of an ancient esoteric science that has been kept secret for centuries. Mystical orders that have been in existence since before ancient Egypt have carefully preserved its secrets totally intact to be released to the public when the time was right. This is the first book to completely unveil these secrets and to show you, in great detail, how to use this fortune-telling system to learn everything about your past, present or future. You are among the first to discover and use the power of this ancient system, which is the original science associated with our common playing cards. </p><p>Inside, you will first discover what your Birth Card is. Once you know what this card is, you will be able to look up any year of your life and read the cards of your Yearly Spreads, which give specific and detailed information about every important area of your life. You will be able to know, in advance, what will be happening in the areas of love, romance, family, work, finances, health, travel, legal matters and your spiritual life, just to mention the most important. You will know what are the best times for marriage, business expansion, changing jobs or lines of work, travel and the sale of real estate. You will be able to see what is going to happen between you and anyone else that you know. People you know will be mentioned in your cards by their exact birthday. The essential nature of all your relationships will be fully explained, both on a lifelong basis and for the year ahead. </p><p>This book will guide you through the simple steps of doing a complete one-year reading for yourself. This one-year reading has specific information concerning each month of the year. In addition to this, you will learn how to do a weekly reading that shows you the influences present for every day of the week. With these two tools, you will have a valuable guide to help you make all your important decisions. Again, you can also use what you learn to do readings for anyone you choose. Many people have turned this science into a full-time career. Just as Arne Lein did, you will be able to make predictions about anyone for any purpose. Its knowledge can be applied to business or personal matters with great success. </p><p>This system is totally unique. Though it involves our common playing cards, you do not need a deck of cards to do a yearly reading, nor will you need any psychic power. All the cards that represent the events and relationships of every month and year of your life are already chosen for you and ready to be looked up in this book. It is like the fabled and mysterious book of destiny that so many ancient myths allude to. You will actually find a record of your entire life within this book. Whether you care to look into the future or the past, the information is here. All you have to learn is where to look it up and how to interpret the language of the cards. The meanings of all the cards are included so that you can easily translate your cards into information you can use. </p><p>To do a reading for yourself or anyone else you only need know three bits of information--1) birth date, 2) sex and 3) occupation. With this information alone, you will be able to access information that is both pertinent and practical. Unlike astrology, you do not need the place or time of birth. </p><p>But how specific and accurate is the information? Most people who learn it are surprised by its uncanny accuracy--how it names specific people and dates for events, often pinpointing exactly what will happen and with whom. I have found that this system is 100 percent accurate. This I have discovered after years of using and studying it. The more you use it, the more accurate it becomes because your comprehension of it increases. In the beginning, you will find it pinpointing specific events in an amazing way. Later, as you become more experienced at using it, you will see that it also shows you the hidden influences that are behind the external manifestations in your life. Its value as a guide for life decisions increases each time you use it.</p></p><h2>Chariots of the Gods?</h2><p>The author reviews archaeological discoveries that have remained unexplained such as the stone figures on Easter Island and various temple and cave drawings, and offers a provocative explanation for them</p><p>Erich von Daniken is the author of the worldwide bestseller Chariots of the Gods and its follow-up, The Eyes of the Sphinx, in addition to over two dozen other books.<br><br>William Dufris has been nominated nine times as a finalist for the APA's prestigious Audie Award and has garnered twenty-one Earphones Awards from AudioFile magazine, which also named him one of the Best Voices at the End of the Century.

I had written the book two years earlier, but rejection letters from publishers fluttered on my desk with great regularity: &#x201c;Sorry, not usable for our program ... ,&#x201d; &#x201c;We are very sorry ... ,&#x201d; &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to go this way ... ,&#x201d; &#x201c;We recommend a more esoteric publisher....&#x201d;</p><p>In later years I was often asked how this publishing miracle happened, to finally place this controversial work with a renowned textbook house. Today I can finally confess: with outside help and a little discretion.</p><p>I met Dr. Thomas von Randow, then the science editor of the weekly <i>Die Zeit,</i> in the summer of 1967. He leafed through the neatly typed manuscript, examined some of the peculiar pictures, and decided, &#x201c;This is not for us. You have to publish it as a book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how does one find a publisher?&#x201d;</p><p>Dr. von Randow puffed on his pipe, looked me straight in the eyes: &#x201c;I do know a publisher. I could just give him a noncommittal call, if you wish.&#x201d;</p><p>He picked up the telephone and asked to be connected with Dr. Erwin Barth von Wehrenalp, the chief of Econ Publishing. The blood rushed to my head. After all, I knew what Dr. von Randow could not know: My manuscript had already been turned down by Econ. Naturally, the ensuing conversation stuck in my gray brain cells.</p></p><h2>Cauldron</h2><p>When a young physicist comes up with an efficient star drive capable of reaching the core of the galaxy, retired star pilot Priscilla &#34;Hutch&#34; Hutchins once again embarks on a perilous mission into the far reaches of outer space to uncover the origins of the deadly Omega clouds, in the follow-up to Odyssey.</p><p><p>Jack McDevitt is a former naval officer, taxi driver, customs officer and motivational trainer. He is a multiple Nebula Award finalist who lives in Georgia with his wife Maureen.</p>Space opera specialist McDevitt shoehorns two traditional SF plots into his latest Academy novel (after 2006's <i>Odyssey</i>), doing both stories a disservice. Youthful physicist Jon Silvestri persuades the philanthropic Prometheus Foundation to back tests of a risky interstellar drive that's vastly superior to current technology. Soon series keystone Priscilla Hutchins finds herself aboard a newly outfitted ship dispatched to the galactic core, seeking the source of a million-year-old interstellar menace. The cast is uniformly likable if prickly, but no true protagonist emerges from McDevitt's ensemble. Some sections are leisurely, others rushed. Readers see little of the star drive research, and the space voyage is triply sidetracked&#x2014;to a planet of cheerfully technophobic aliens, an abandoned world with unexpected dangers and a black hole with a tantalizing secret&#x2014;before reaching its stated objective, where the threat's origin is summarily introduced and disposed of in the last 60 pages. Despite considerable inventiveness and an enthusiastic pro-space agenda, the story remains superficial, especially frustrating from a writer of McDevitt's caliber. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His is a first-rate talent and we are lucky that he has started so young to write so well. Here is a fine novel.&#34; From its dazzling opening page, which announced the appearance of a stylist of the first rank, to its moving close, this brief novel has charmed and captivated millions of readers since its publication twenty-five years ago and its subsequent translation into fifteen languages. On the triumphant publication of Kate Vaiden, his most recent novel, in 1986, there was almost no review that -- praising the new book to the skies -- didn&#39;t also mention in glowing terms the reviewer&#39;s fond recollection of the marvelous first novel, the troubled love story of Rosacoke Mustian and Wesley Beavers and its beautifully evoked vision of rural North Carolina. It is a pleasure now to restore to print the clothbound edition of this truly enduring work as a companion volume to his brilliant book of essays, A Common Room, published simultaneously.</p><p><b>Reynolds Price</b> was born in Macon, North Carolina in 1933. Educated at Duke University and, as a Rhodes Scholar, at Merton College, Oxford University, he has taught at Duke since 1958 and is now James B. Duke Professor of English.<p>His first short stories, and many later ones, are published in his <i>Collected Stories</i>. <i>A Long and Happy Life</i> was published in 1962 and won the William Faulkner Award for a best first novel. <i>Kate Vaiden</i> was published in 1986 and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. <i>The Good Priest's Son</i> in 2005 was his fourteenth novel. Among his thirty-seven volumes are further collections of fiction, poetry, plays, essays, and translations. Price is a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and his work has been translated into seventeen languages.</p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Just with his body and from inside like a snake, leaning that black motorcycle side to side, cutting in and out of the slow line of cars to get there first, staring due-north through goggles towards Mount Moriah and switching coon tails in everybody's face was Wesley Beavers, and laid against his back like sleep, spraddle-legged on the sheepskin seat behind him was Rosacoke Mustian who was maybe his girl and who had given up looking into the wind and trying to nod at every sad car in the line, and when he even speeded up and passed the truck (lent for the afternoon by Mr. Isaac Alston and driven by Sammy his man, hauling one pine box and one black boy dressed in all he could borrow, set up in a ladder-back chair with flowers banked round him and a foot on the box to steady it) -- when he even passed that, Rosacoke said once into his back "Don't" and rested in humiliation, not thinking but with her hands on his hips for dear life and her white blouse blown out behind her like a banner in defeat. </p><p> It was because Wesley was a motorcycle man since his discharge (or would be, come Monday) and wouldn't have brought her in a car if fire had fallen in balls on every side. He had intended taking her to the picnic that way, and when Mildred Sutton died having her baby without a husband and Rosacoke felt compelled to go to the funeral first and asked Wesley please to take her, he said he would, but he saw no reason to change to a car for a Negro funeral. Rosacoke had to get there and couldn't walk three miles in dust and couldn't risk him going on ahead so she didn't argue but pulled her skirt up over her knees for all to see and put her hat in the saddlebag and climbed on. </p><p> Riding like that she didn't see the land they passed through -- nothing new or strange but what she had passed every day of her life almost, except for the very beginning and some summer clays when she had left for 4-H camp at White Lake or to stay with Aunt Oma in Newport News or to set with somebody in the hospital, like Papa before he died. But the land was there, waiting. </p><p> The road passed a little way from the Mustians' porch, and if you came up their driveway and turned left, you would be at the Afton store and the paving soon, and that took you on to Warrenton where she worked. But they turned right today and the road narrowed as it went till it was only wide enough for one thing going one way -- a car or a truck or a mule and wagon -- and it being July, whatever passed, even the smallest foot, ground more dirt to dust that rose several times every hour of the day and occasionally -- invisibly -- at night and lingered awhile and at sunset hung like fog and if there was no breeze, settled back on whatever was there to receive it -- Rosacoke and Mama and Rato and Milo walking to church, if it had been a first Sunday and ten years ago before Milo got his driving license -- but settling mostly on Negro children aiming home in a slow line, carrying blackberries they had picked to eat (and if you stopped and said, "How much you asking for your berries?" they would be so surprised and shy and forget the price their mother told them to say if anybody stopped, and hand them over, bucket and all, for whatever you wanted to give, and all the dust you raised would be on those berries when you got home). It settled on leaves too -- on dogwood and hickory and thin pine and holly and now and then a sycamore and on Mr. Isaac Alston's cherry trees that huddled around the pond he had made for the hot air to pass over, choked and tan till there would come a rain -- trees he had set out as switches twelve years ago on his seventieth birthday and poured fish in the water smaller than the eye could see and claimed he would live to sit in that cool cherry shade and pull out the dim descendants of those first minnows. And he might, as the Alstons didn't die under ninety. </p><p> What Alstons <i>had</i> died were the things they came to, after trees -- the recent ones, overflowed from the family graves and laid out on this side of Delight Baptist Church, looking shorter than anybody would have guessed, with people around them that never had family graves to begin with -- Rosacoke's Papa (who was her grandfather and who by the time he died had completely forgotten Miss Pauline his wife and asked to be buried beside his mother and then forgot to tell them where his mother was) and Miss Pauline, the size of a dressed rabbit, and Rosacoke's own father who was no Baptist (who wasn't much of anything) and whose grave had sunk into the ground. The graves went towards the church, taking grass with them, and then the white sand began that had been hauled in from a creek bed. The church stood in the sand under two oak trees, wooden and bleached and square as a gun-shell box, daring people not to come. The Mustians went and even Wesley Beavers, with <i>his</i> name. </p><p> But it wasn't where they were going now so they passed by, and the graves and Delight Church and the sand and the two long picnic tables turned to the woods that Milo and Rosacoke and Rato had run in as children with Mildred Sutton and any other Negroes she brought along (that had scattered now, to Baltimore mostly). The woods began by the road and went back farther than Rosacoke or even the boys had ever gone, not because they were scared but because they got tired -- the woods went on that long, and every leaf of them belonged to Mr. Isaac Alston. Once Rosacoke and Mildred packed them a dinner and said to themselves, "We will walk till we come to an open field where somebody is growing something." So they walked on slowly in a straight line through the cool damp air under trees where sun never came but only this green light the mushrooms grew by. When they had walked an hour, they were breathing in air that nothing but possums and owls had breathed before, and snakes if snakes breathed. Mildred didn't like the idea but Rosacoke kept going, and Mildred came on behind, looking mostly <i>up,</i> checking on the sky to still be there and to see what snakes were studying down on them. Then they came to an open field the size of a circus ring where there were no trees but only bitter old briars and broomstraw the color of Milo's beard that was just then arriving. They sat on the edge of that to eat their biscuits and syrup and for Mildred to rest her feet, but Rosacoke thought and decided they couldn't stop here as it wasn't a field where anybody had <i>meant</i> to grow anything. (Nothing ate broomstraw but mules and mules only ate it if they thought it was something you valued.) So they stood up to go, and Mildred's mouth fell open and said "Great God A-mighty" because there was one deer behind them in the trees for quicker than it took to say if it had horns. But its eyes were black and it had looked at them. When its last sound had gone, Rosacoke said, "Don't let's go no farther" and Mildred said "All right." They were not afraid of any deer, but if those woods offered things like that, that would take the time to look at you, when you had only walked an hour, where <i>would</i> they end, and what would be growing in any field they found on the other side, and who would be tending it there? So they came out, taking their time, proving they hadn't given up for fear, and when they got to the road, Mildred spoke for the first time since calling on God to see that deer -- "Rosacoke, it's time for me some supper" -- and they parted. It was no more time for supper than it was for snow, but Mildred meant to get home quick and unload that deer on somebody -- his streak he made through the trees and the sound of his horn feet in the old leaves and his eyes staring on through all those biscuits at what they did, and waiting. </p><p> If Rosacoke had looked up from Wesley's back at the woods, she might have remembered that day and how it was only nine years ago and here she was headed to bury that same Mildred, and was that black-eyed deer still waiting, and did <i>he</i> belong to Mr. Isaac? -- that deer? But she didn't look up and she didn't remember. If you were with Wesley Beavers, what good was remembering? You couldn't tell him what you remembered. He said he lived in the present, and that meant that maybe when he went a hundred and thirty miles from home to spend three years in the U.S. Navy, lounging around in a tight uniform fixing radios and not moving a step out of Norfolk, Virginia (or so he said) except to come home a few weekends, maybe he seldom thought of her. Not the way she thought of him anyhow -- wondering every night if she was his, hoping she was, even when he didn't write for weeks and then sent sassy post cards. But he had been home a civilian three days now, and tomorrow he was headed back to Norfolk to sell motorcycles with a friend of his, and she didn't know a thing she hadn't known for years -- which was that he still came to get her Saturday night and took her to a place called Danceland and danced with every woman there in succession so fast he seemed to be ten Wesleys or a dozen, swarming, and then rode her home and kissed her good night for an hour, without a question or a word. </p><p> She thought that through once. It was the deepest thinking she could manage on a motorcycle with dust running up her legs, and she was just changing to something new -- that at last Wesley had found the vehicle he was meant for (being with Wesley had always been like being on a motorcycle) -- when she felt the shift of his shoulders under her cheek and his hips under her hands. The way he moved she slackened her grip for a second. It was too much like holding your eye through the lid while it turns, smooth in the socket but easy to ruin. </p><p> She looked up and they were at Mount Moriah Church where they meant to be, and Wesley was turning in, not slowing up at all but gouging a great rut in the dusty yard. He stuck out a leg and his black ankle boots plowed a little way, and that halted them under the one low tree. The coon tails relaxed but Wesley kept the motor going, racing it with twitches of his hand, listening as if he expected it to speak, till Rosa-coke said in his ear, "Hush your noise, Wesley." </p><p> "Don't it sound funny to you?" </p><p> "No," she said. So he let the motor die, and in the astonished quiet where every bird had surrendered to Wesley's roar, the only sound was that truck and the cars coming on behind, rambling like distant buffaloes, with Mildred. "Get down, Wesley. They'll all be here in a minute." Wesley swung off the seat and watched while Rosacoke got herself down. Now they were still, the heat settled back on them, and they both shook their heads under the burden. But they didn't speak. They had given up talking about it long ago. Rosacoke took out her handkerchief and wiped her face before the sweat could streak the dust. She looked in the round mirror on the handlebars and combed out her hair that had the wind in it still after the ride. With the black tree behind her, you could see the dust fly up around her head from out of her hair, and in the round mirror it outlined her with a sudden halo. Even Wesley noticed that. Then she put on her hat and said, "We didn't need to come <i>that</i> quick" and took off towards the church, sinking through the thin crust of ground with her high heels. When she had walked ten yards alone and her white shoes were tan, she turned and said, <i>"Come</i> on, Wesley. Let's don't be standing around staring when they get here." </p><p> "Well, I'm going to work on this motor awhile to make sure we can get out when we want to. I'll be in there in a little bit. You just save me a seat by the window." </p><p> She only blushed -- all she ever did now when Wesley let her down (which pretty nearly kept her blushing non-stop) -- and said, "Don't go playing that harp" (the harmonica was another thing he had taken up in the Navy) and climbed the steps. She stopped at the top and looked back towards the road. That way, Wesley saw her and thought how far she had come in three years to being this -- tall almost as he was, maybe five foot-nine, and her skin pale as candles laid close on her long bones, and what wind there was, twitching at her hair pulled to the back of her neck, falling down long and dry and the color of straw from under her level hat, stopping below her shoulders where your hand would have been if you had been holding her and dancing with her, close (the only way Wesley danced since his discharge). Then his eyes moved on. And every time he passed below her swinging hair -- looking -- he got onto women he knew in Norfolk or at the beach and how they smelled, twisting in the dark, and how their smell stayed on him now he didn't recollect their names or how they looked though he had labored in them whole nights of his life and the feel of them was on his fingers like oil, real as if they were by him now under that tree, calling him Junior with their hands working and him starting and them crying "Sweet Jesus? to him in the night. </p><p> But suddenly a bird sang in the tree over Wesley's head, holding up its one clear voice like a deed in the scorching day, and Rosacoke looked at Wesley as if he might have done it -- that song -- looking clear through him and all he thought, it seemed, shaking her head at what she saw. But Wesley was twenty-two years old his last birthday, and what was so wrong, he wanted to know, with thinking all those things? -- except maybe they didn't fit Rosacoke, not the way she was now, new and changed since the times three years ago when they went in to shows in Warrenton and drove nearly home and stopped and spent an hour or longer telling each other good night with the windows misted up, sitting under a tree with pecans falling on the car to make them laugh. Those other women, he had touched and claimed whenever he needed to, but how much of Rosacoke had he touched? Knowing her all that time, how much of her could he see whenever his eyes were dosed? How much of her could he claim? -- her standing on church steps in Sunday white, straining to see where Mildred was -- how much of that could he just walk up and ask for and get? </p><p> He might have tried to find out if she hadn't turned and vanished in the dark church, not meaning to roll her hips but letting loose all the power she had there (which was enough to grind rocks) and showing, last thing, her white ankles flexing firm on her heels, and Jesus, he was back in Norfolk sure as the sun poured down. And it did -- all over Wesley Beavers from head to foot which was half the trouble. So to change the subject he took out his cycle tools and tightened screws that were tighter already than God ever meant them to be. </p><p> Rosacoke remembered in the vestibule that she hadn't been here since the day she slipped off with Mildred and came to the meeting where Aunt Mannie Mayfield stood at age eighty and named the fathers of all her children, far as she could recall. Rosacoke looked round now and the same three things to notice were there -- a bell rope hanging from the steeple for anybody to pull, and a gray paper hornets' nest (built in the window by mistake during the war but deserted now far as the eye could see though nobody would tear it down for fear one hornet might be there still, getting older and meaner), and by the open door to the auditorium, a paper bag nailed to the wall with a note saying, <i>Kindly Leave Gu...</i></p></p><h2>Geronimo Stilton Heromice: Mice of The Rescue - 1</h2><p>In Heromice: Mice to the Rescue!, Geronimo Stilton helps watch over Muskrat City.

Antieux: The Stress of Peace <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Brother Candle settled at the breakfast table, still sleep-groggy. <br>&#x201c;Look at him being smug. All fruit and berries, there.&#x201d; <br>A dozen people shared the table, Count Raymone Garete&#x2019;s intimates. His spouse, the Countess Socia, had made the disparaging remark. <br>Count Raymone&#x2019;s cousin Bernardin said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind her, Master. She&#x2019;s looking for a fight again. Or still. Calm down, girl. Peace has broken out. Enjoy it.&#x201d; <br>Brother Candle nodded. He agreed. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Socia knew it could not last. <br>The world would pull itself together and get back to the horrors soon. <br>Following a bite of melon, the old man observed, &#x201c;The world has rolled over complete when Bernardin Amberchelle is the voice of reason.&#x201d; To the Countess, so like a daughter after all they had suffered, he said, &#x201c;Control your emotions. For the sake of the child.&#x201d; <br>Socia was gravid in the extreme. That exacerbated her naturally abrasive character. The baby was overdue. It would be her first. She was plagued by all the first-time terrors. She refused to follow the custom of her station and go into seclusion. <br>Socia Garete was no ornament to her husband. She was a working partner, even a managing partner. She did not want to miss anything. <br>The Count, the Maysalean Perfect Brother Candle, and everyone else for whom she cared, and who cared for her, had abandoned hope of getting her to behave as a proper noblewoman. <br>Hell, she spent half her time with an equally injudicious commoner refugee heretic from Khaurene, Kedle Richeut. She idolized Kedle. Kedle Richeut had made a difference. Kedle had killed a king. <br>Brother Candle had known Socia since she was a bloody-minded teen living with three brothers in a small stronghold on the Connec&#x2019;s northeast frontier. Never had she shown the least inclination to be a good girl, focused on embroidery and producing children. <br>As always, Count Raymone showed only amused indulgence. He loved Socia with the passion and depth sung by the Connec&#x2019;s jongleurs, unusual in a time of negotiated marriages. But Raymone Garete had come into his patrimony young. Those who would have strapped him into a loveless political alliance had passed on before he could be fitted to harness. <br>Count Raymone had chosen Socia on brief exposure because he had recognized her instantly as a soul perfectly complementary to himself. <br>Count Raymone said, &#x201c;At this point, my love, you should listen attentively when the Master speaks.&#x201d; <br>Startled, Socia shut her mouth. <br>Raymone continued, &#x201c;I understand. I have my own problems adjusting to an absence of enemies. The fact is, we aren&#x2019;t likely to have any till Anselin gets home or Serenity makes a startling comeback.&#x201d; <br>Bernardin said, &#x201c;Anselin shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. He won&#x2019;t let his mother bully him. I&#x2019;ll bet a shilling now that he stuffs her into a convent.&#x201d; <br>Socia made snarling noises to remind everyone that she was in a foul humor. Still. <br>Raymone ignored her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even fritter time chasing Society brothers. The survivors are hidden so deep they&#x2019;ve forgotten which way to swim to find the light.&#x201d; <br>Brother Candle grumbled, &#x201c;If they cared about the Light they wouldn&#x2019;t be in the Society for the Suppression of Sacrilege and Heresy in the first place.&#x201d; <br>Bernardin chuckled through a mouthful of salt pork. He professed the Maysalean creed but refused to observe its dietary whims. &#x201c;Been a few weeks since I&#x2019;ve nabbed one. But the rest aren&#x2019;t buried as deep as they hope. The new bishop isn&#x2019;t as clever as he thinks.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;LaVelle?&#x201d; Brother Candle asked. <br>&#x201c;The very one. The latest. Dumber than a keg of rocks but the first honest one since way back before Serifs. I&#x2019;m going to make sure he survives.&#x201d; <br>For a decade Episcopal Chaldarean bishops had shown a remarkable inability to stay healthy in a bishopric the Church was determined to scourge and flense for tolerating heresy. <br>&#x201c;Honest?&#x201d; Brother Candle asked. <br>Bernardin offered a wobbling hand gesture. &#x201c;Comparatively. He did bring along a clutch of deadbeat relatives. But he&#x2019;s no holy bandit like Meryl Pont� or Mathe Richenau.&#x201d; <br>Count Raymone interjected, &#x201c;Darling, when was your last visit to Mistress Alecsinac?&#x201d; Alecsinac was her senior attendant midwife. <br>Clever, in Brother Candle&#x2019;s thinking. Stopping Bernardin from admitting he had an agent close to the new bishop, in case LaVelle or the Society had an agent close to the Count. <br>There was a point to Raymone&#x2019;s question beyond that. <br>Socia did not deliver a definitive response. <br>&#x201c;I thought so. Master. Once you finish, see my lady Socia to the midwife. Making no side trips and accepting no delays or excuses.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As you will.&#x201d; Brother Candle allowed himself a satisfied smile. <br>Count Raymone seldom invoked a husband&#x2019;s prerogative. When he did, he meant it. There was no appeal. <br>Brother Candle asked, &#x201c;Does LaVelle have any support from Brothe?&#x201d; <br>Amberchelle replied, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying to figure that out. Serenity appointed him, but only two days before they ran him off. Serenity didn&#x2019;t know him. He was put up by one of Anne of Menand&#x2019;s tame Principat�s, Gorman Sleight. Sleight doesn&#x2019;t know LaVelle, either. He nominated LaVelle on behalf of Valmur Joss, one of the Society chiefs in exile in Salpeno. Joss is Connecten. But even he doesn&#x2019;t actually know LaVelle, whose name originally got dropped into the process by a cousin, Laci Lindop, another Connecten Society exile. LaVelle has no prior Church connection, except as a worshipper. So nobody knows what we&#x2019;re getting.&#x201d; <br>The Perfect stared. Bernardin Amberchelle was a short, wide, dusky, rumpled man who looked like a dimwit thug. And he played that role on Raymone&#x2019;s behalf. In private, though, he betrayed surprising depth. <br>Amberchelle winked. <br>Refusing to be left out, Socia asked, &#x201c;Do we know where Serenity went when he ran away from the Captain-General?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That would be the Commander of the Righteous, dear one. Piper Hecht. He used to be Captain-General, before Serenity. Pinkus Ghort is Captain-General now. Serenity&#x2019;s man, bought and paid for.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not so much anymore,&#x201d; Bernardin said. &#x201c;Ghort gets on fine with the man Hecht installed in Serenity&#x2019;s place.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But where is Serenity?&#x201d; Socia demanded. &#x201c;And how big a pain is he likely to be?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Right now he&#x2019;s on Little Pinoch� in the Pinoch� Islands, off the Firaldian coast two-thirds of the way up between the mouth of the Teragi and the mouth of the Sawn. He&#x2019;d be a major pain if he could but he can&#x2019;t communicate very well. Sonsa and Platadura are blockading him. Queen Isabeth intends to keep him fixed till she makes him pay for what happened to Peter.&#x201d; <br>He meant Isabeth of Khaurene, sister of Duke Tormond IV, wife and queen of Peter of Navaya. After an outstanding career taming the enemies of the Church, Peter had fallen defending his wife&#x2019;s home city from Arnhanders who had invaded with the blessing of the Church. <br>Serenity had an obsessive hatred of the Connec. He had suffered terribly when he was Patriarchal legate in Antieux. Before becoming Patriarch he had participated in several campaigns against Antieux. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll find ways to communicate,&#x201d; Socia muttered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be a reason he fled to those islands.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Bernardin laughed. &#x201c;There is. That&#x2019;s where the storm put him down.&#x201d; He explained. Serenity&#x2019;s convoy, hugging the coast, had been caught in a squall and driven off shore. Serenity&#x2019;s vessel had gone aground on rocks off Little Pinoch�. The deposed Patriarch was among the few survivors. &#x201c;He was headed for Arnhand. Anne of Menand would have taken him in.&#x201d; But ships from Navaya&#x2019;s allies had set a blockade almost before Serenity had gotten himself dried out. <br>Brother Candle pushed back from the table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve begun to suffer an intellectual malaise. I&#x2019;ve become too comfortable here.&#x201d; <br>Bernardin observed, &#x201c;Here he goes, fishing for compliments.&#x201d; <br>Socia snapped, &#x201c;Bernardin, you&#x2019;re too cynical. He&#x2019;s a Perfect. They&#x2019;re never happy unless they&#x2019;re barefoot in the snow, starving, and being hunted by people who want to burn them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This one squeals like a pig whenever we ask him to do something where he might get his tootsies wet.&#x201d; <br>Pressed, Brother Candle would have admitted as much. But he was sixty-eight years old. That slowed a man. It left him inclined to ease the strain on his bones. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back on the road soon enough to beat the first snow.&#x201d; Snow arrived earlier every winter. <br>All conversation died. All eyes turned to the Perfect. <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why on earth would you&#x2026;?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;At your age?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My age? My age wasn&#x2019;t a factor when somebody wanted me hustling messages and tokens back and forth between Antieux and Khaurene.&#x201d; <br>Socia said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a factor because you mean so much to us. We don&#x2019;t want you to leave.&#x201d; <br>The Count agreed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s as plain as it can be said, Master.&#x201d; <br>Socia added, &#x201c;You keep up this nonsense, I&#x2019;ll get Kedle to break your leg.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That seems harsh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tough love, old man. Tough love.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep that in mind. It is an intimidating journey and these old bones do have too many miles on them already. Meantime, though, I have to deliver you to the mercies of Mistress Alecsinac.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d forget.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Get going, Socia,&#x201d; Raymone snapped. <br>&#x201c;An&#x2019; it please Your Lordship.&#x201d; Socia rose, offered a mock bow. It was none too deep. Her stomach got in the way. Leaving the room a step behind the Perfect, she said, &#x201c;Mistress Alecsinac may know how to convince this beast that it&#x2019;s time to leave.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Glen Cook <br></p><h2>Hotel Stories: Legendary Hideaways of the World</h2><p>Open Hotel Stories and you will be transported to the most talked about haunts across the globe: Greta Garbo was "born" in a Berlin palace; "James Bond" was created in a house in Jamaica; Al Capone lived his last days in a hotel in Miami; Frida Kahlo escaped with Leon Trotsky to a hacienda in the Mexican countryside.

Now living in France, she writes about countries as diverse as Rwanda, Turkey, France, and Japan for National Geographic France, Conde Nast Traveler, Air France Monsieur, and the San Luis Obispo Tribune.</p><h2>Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in Genealogy</h2><p><p>What does it mean to be truthful? What role does truth play in our lives? What do we lose if we reject truthfulness? No philosopher is better suited to answer these questions than Bernard Williams. Writing with his characteristic combination of passion and elegant simplicity, he explores the value of truth and finds it to be both less and more than we might imagine.</p><br><p> Modern culture exhibits two attitudes toward truth: suspicion of being deceived (no one wants to be fooled) and skepticism that objective truth exists at all (no one wants to be naive). This tension between a demand for truthfulness and the doubt that there is any truth to be found is not an abstract paradox. It has political consequences and signals a danger that our intellectual activities, particularly in the humanities, may tear themselves to pieces.</p><br><p> Williams's approach, in the tradition of Nietzsche's genealogy, blends philosophy, history, and a fictional account of how the human concern with truth might have arisen. Without denying that we should worry about the contingency of much that we take for granted, he defends truth as an intellectual objective and a cultural value. He identifies two basic virtues of truth, Accuracy and Sincerity, the first of which aims at finding out the truth and the second at telling it. He describes different psychological and social forms that these virtues have taken and asks what ideas can make best sense of them today.</p><br><br><p> <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> presents a powerful challenge to the fashionable belief that truth has no value, but equally to the traditional faith that its value guarantees itself. Bernard Williams shows us that when we lose a sense of the value of truth, we lose a lot both politically and personally, and may well lose everything.</p></p><p><p>"In this exceptionally brilliant book, ranging effortlessly from Herodotus and Thucydides to Diderot and Nietzsche, Bernard Williams daringly asks--and still more daringly answers--one of the central questions of philosophy: what is the point of telling the truth? Lucid, penetrating, and profound, Williams' reflections are vitally important not for philosophers alone but for anyone interested in human thought and creativity."--<b>Stephen Greenblatt, Cogan University Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This is a major, wide-ranging, and comprehensive book. A philosophical investigation that is also a literary and historical study, <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> asks how and why we have come to think of accuracy, sincerity, and authenticity as virtues. Bernard Williams' account of their emergence is as detailed and imaginative as his defense of their importance is spirited and provocative. Williams asks hard questions, and gives them straightforward and controversial answers.

The book also offers an overview of the development of fashion, as seen through the eyes of the greatest illustrators of the day. Early in the century fashion illustration reflected new, liberating currents in art and culture, such as the exoticism of the Ballets Russes, while the postwar period saw inspiration from the great Parisian couturiers. After the dominance of the celebrity fashion photographer in the &#39;60s, a new generation of illustrators emerged, embracing the medium of the computer, while many returned to more traditional techniques.</p><p>Cally Blackman is a writer and lecturer with degrees in Fashion Design and History of Art, and an MA in History of Dress from the Courtauld Institute of Art, London.

Montroll's reputation among origamists and with the Origami Center of America has been growing since he showed a penchant for paperfolding at age six. At age 14, when he became an associate of the Center, he was already creating unique models. Today he is considered one of the most original creators in this elegant Japanese art &#x2014; and this is the first published collection of his extraordinary work.<br>Animals can be among the most demanding subjects in the field. Montroll's animal patterns are perhaps more rigorous than most, but the lucid, step-by-step instructions, illustrated every step of the way, enable the dedicated origamist to learn advanced techniques. The animals are arranged in order of complexity, with Pegasus, the camel, the mountain goat, and a few others requiring as many as 70 steps. Careful attention to the first projects will smooth the way for the later animals. The paper menagerie consists of a fish, vulture, robin, squirrel, Pegasus, goldfish, catfish, peacock, rhinoceros, moth, seahorse, rabbit, elephant, stink bug, whale, stork, skunk, beetle, sunfish, mountain goat, goose, mouse, camel, grasshopper, and ostrich.<br>As will become apparent, once the basic form of the animal is achieved, slight variations may be introduced to alter the stance or even the nature of the animal, as with the moth, which after the eleventh step may metamorphose into a stink bug at the artist's whim.<br>Instructions for the standard folds and a guide to the symbols pave the path to some of the most intriguing and enjoyable challenges in origami. This book of original paperfolding projects offers origamists the chance to exercise their skills on original designs of great and delicate beauty.</p><p></p></p><p>Internationally renowned author John Montroll has significantly increased the origami repertoire with his original designs. Best known as the inspiration behind the single-square, no-cuts, no-glue approach, the American origami master presents meticulously developed folding sequences that result in better models with fewer steps.</p><h2>Midnight Clear: A Callahan Garrity Mystery</h2><p>When his shrewish wife is found murdered just before Christmas, Callahan Garrity&#39;s estranged brother goes on the lam, leaving her with the daughter he has kidnapped and the hope of clearing his name. Reissue.</p><p>Christmas festivities and family bonding provide the backdrop in this seventh mystery featuring cleaning service owner-operator Callahan Garrity. While Callahan and her mother Edna are busy preparing trifle and a potent Garrity version of eggnog for their annual Christmas bash, Callahan's youngest brother, Brian, appears after a 10-year absence. Edna is thrilled, both with Brian and with the granddaughter he has presented; Callahan is more dubious, particularly when it becomes clear that her brother has been in town for well over a year and that he has taken the 3-year-old Maura without her mother's permission. Callahan, with pressure from Edna, agrees to help Brian fight the custody battle against his ex, but things only get more complicated once the woman is found stabbed to death. Police, not surprisingly, put Brian at the top of their list of likely suspects. After all, if he is willing to commit one felony by kidnapping his daughter, what's to prevent him from murdering her mother? <p> Despite overtones of O.J.--Brian is also accused of occasionally resorting to violence--there is much to enjoy here: Edna's toilet-training philosophy, Maura's precociousness, and the suburban South's peculiar social dimensions (just what constitutes white trash, anyway?) provide much to chuckle over. Callahan and her band of merry mop-bearers take on the police, Brian's mother-in-law, and even Brian himself to demonstrate his innocence so that he can stay out of jail and secure custody. Callahan is an admirable and entertaining heroine. Kathy Hogan Trocheck has a lighter touch than Sarah Paretsky or Sue Grafton, and Callahan is rarely as unforgivably foolhardy as counterparts V.I. Warshawski or Kinsey Milhone can be. With Callahan and her more charming relations at the novel's heart, <i>Midnight Clear</i> offers jolly holiday reading with both poignant and hilarious moments. <i>--K.

Eisenhower prepared to leave the White House in 1961, he did so with an ominous message for the American people about the "disastrous rise" of the military-industrial complex. Fifty years later, the complex has morphed into a virtually unstoppable war machine, one that dictates U.S. economic and foreign policy in a direct and substantial way.</p><p>Based on his experiences as an award-winning Washington-based reporter covering national security, James McCartney presents a compelling history, from the Cold War to present day that shows that the problem is far worse and far more wide-reaching than anything Eisenhower could have imagined. Big Military has become "too big to fail" and has grown to envelope the nation's political, cultural and intellectual institutions. These centers of power and influence, including the now-complicit White House and Congress, have a vested interest in preparing and waging unnecessary wars. The authors persuasively argue that not one foreign intervention in the past 50 years has made us or the world safer.</p><p>With additions by Molly Sinclair McCartney, a fellow journalist with 30 years of experience, <i>America's War Machine</i> provides the context for today's national security state and explains what can be done about it.</p></p><p><p>JAMES MCCARTNEY had covered every president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Bill Clinton. McCartney covered the White House, the State department, the Pentagon and relevant committees on Capitol Hill. He reported from about 30 countries, including Vietnam, the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Europe. After retirement from daily journalism, he taught courses in foreign policy and politics at Georgetown University. McCartney's papers, including about 4,000 of his articles, are in the Special Collections Research Center at Georgetown University's Lauringer Library.</p><p>MOLLY SINCLAIR MCCARTNEY worked as a newspaper reporter more than 25 years, including 14 years at the <i>Washington Post</i>. In 2012 she was appointed a Woodrow Wilson Public Scholar in Washington D.C. to do the research and interviews needed to finish <i>America's War Machine.</i></p><p>"The McCartneys' book provides a crisp, clear analysis of the state of the Military Industrial Complex more than 50 years after Eisenhower and his advisors coined the term. The authors deploy dozens of examples to make their case that unfortunately, the Military Industrial Complex is alive and well, with an outsized role in determining not only how much to spend on the Pentagon, but also on whether the country is at war or at peace....

But to Frances&#39;s dismay, Johnny is hesitant to marry her. Attempting to ease her aching heart, Frances accepts an offer to go to New York City and escort a group of orphans out West to new homes. Along the way, she must deal with a flood of painful memories and a threatening stranger. Will Frances be able to complete her mission... and return home to find out what her future will be?</p><p>Grade 5-8. This latest installment in the life of the Kelly family focuses on 19-year-old Frances, who doesn't understand why Johnny Mueller, recovering physically and emotionally from a year in a Confederate POW camp, feels unready to commit to marriage. Hurt, she agrees to accompany an orphan who is to be reunited with his aunt and uncle in New York City where she becomes an escort for 30 orphan-train children on the return trip. At this point, much of the story becomes repetitive. Over and over Frances soothes frightened children, recalls her own fears, broods over Johnny, and ties bows in the girls' hair before they meet prospective parents at each stop. Her encounter with a former Confederate soldier-turned-bank-robber, traveling disguised as a minister, adds some excitement and gives her a new perspective on Johnny. The conclusion, in which Frances and Johnny are reconciled and agree to adopt rambunctious, charming Eddie, whom no one else wants, is predictable but comforting. Don't expect this story to deliver the punch of earlier titles in this series, such as Keeping Secrets (1995) or A Dangerous Promise (1994; both Delacorte).

Rooted in historical fact, the narrative follows Frances' adventures on the train, the same train that carried her to an adoptive home just six years earlier. As Frances tries to meet the needs of her charges, she struggles with her own emotions. The story contains sadness, love, danger, and suspense. Young readers familiar with the Orphan Train Adventures series will not want to miss this installment. <i>Susan DeRonne</i></p><h2>Jackie as Editor: The Literary Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</h2><p><i>An absorbing chronicle of a much overlooked chapter in Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&#x2019;s life&#x2014;her nineteen-year editorial career <p></p></i>History remembers Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as the consummate first lady, the nation&#x2019;s tragic widow, the millionaire&#x2019;s wife, and, of course, the quintessential embodiment of elegance. Her biographers, however, skip over an equally&nbsp;important stage in her life: her nearly twenty year long career as a book editor. <i>Jackie as Editor</i> is the first book to focus exclusively on this remarkable woman&#x2019;s editorial career. <p></p>At the age of forty-six, one of the most famous women in the world went to work for the first time in twenty-two years. Greg Lawrence, who had three of his books edited by Jackie, draws from interviews with more than 125 of her former collaborators and acquaintances in the publishing world to examine one of the twentieth century's most enduring subjects of fascination through a new angle: her previously untouted skill in the career she chose. Over the last third of her life, Jackie would master a new industry, weather a very public professional scandal, and shepherd&nbsp;more than&nbsp;a hundred books through the increasingly corporate halls of Viking and Doubleday, publishing authors as diverse as Diana Vreeland, Louis Auchincloss, George Plimpton, Bill Moyers, Dorothy West, Naguib Mahfouz, and even Michael Jackson.&nbsp;<i>Jackie as Editor </i>gives intimate new insights into the life of a complex and enigmatic woman who found fulfillment through her creative career during book publishing&#x2019;s legendary Golden Age, and, away from the public eye, quietly defined life on her own terms.</p><p>GREG LAWRENCE is the author&nbsp;or coauthor of seven previous books, including <i>Colored Lights </i>(with John Kander and Fred Ebb), <i>Dance With Demons, Time Steps </i>(with Donna McKechnie),&nbsp;the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Dancing on My Grave, The Shape of Love, </i>and <i>The Little Ballerina and her Dancing Horse, </i>the last three edited by Jackie Onassis.<i>1<br></i>&nbsp;<br><i>A Special Destiny</i><br>During the summer of 1975, after entering her second widowhood, Jackie resumed her life in Manhattan with her children, hoping somehow to establish some normalcy in their lives. At the time, some of Jackie&#x2019;s friends noticed that she seemed to have fallen into a malaise, with fitful bouts of boredom and restlessness. Society chronicler Stephen Birmingham had dated Jackie briefly when she was a Vassar undergraduate and kept in touch with her in later years. Of this dismal interlude while Jackie was cast adrift, Birmingham said, &#x201c;When she telephoned friends to chat, she seemed to have little to chat about.&#x201d; More than just an episode of midlife ennui, it was to be a prolonged period of mourning that sometimes found Jackie listless and lingering for hours over breakfast and the morning newspapers in her apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. Jackie once admitted, &#x201c;I have a tendency to go into a downward spiral of depression or isolation when I&#x2019;m sad.&#x201d;<br>The world was not about to leave her in peace. On a visit she made in August to the amphitheater at Epidaurus, a hostile Greek crowd taunted Jackie with jeers and cries of &#x201c;You left your dead husband.&#x201d; Her tormentors were apparently unaware of how sudden and unexpected Ari&#x2019;s death had been, and blamed Jackie for not being with him when he died. On March 15, 1975, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Onassis had succumbed to bronchial pneumonia, a complication of the myasthenia gravis with which he was afflicted in his last years. Jackie was in Manhattan at the time. Though the marriage was failing, Jackie had stayed in Paris dutifully to support Ari through his surgery earlier that month, until being assured by his doctors that he was stable. She then returned to New York to be with Caroline for the airing of an NBC documentary that her daughter had worked on as a member of the production crew, under the tutelage of film producer Karen Lerner. Karen was the ex-wife of Alan Jay Lerner, lyricist for the musical <i>Camelot,</i> and a friend of JFK&#x2019;s going back to their schooldays at Choate.<br>Karen was staying as a guest in Jackie&#x2019;s opulent apartment, sleeping in Onassis&#x2019;s bed in a bedroom next to Jackie&#x2019;s. &#x201c;On the morning of March 15,&#x201d; Lerner remembered, &#x201c;she came in and said, &#x2018;Ari&#x2019;s dead.&#x2019; You know, she got a lot of criticism for being in New York because she was giving a party on the day this little documentary aired for Caroline.&#x201d; With her dinner party scheduled to take place the following evening, Jackie told Karen, &#x201c;I am going to Paris, so you stay here and you be the hostess.... I don&#x2019;t want anything to disturb this&#x2014;it&#x2019;s for Caroline and I just want it to go ahead.&#x201d;<br>Lerner, who had known Jackie during the Kennedy era and through her marriage to Onassis, later observed, &#x201c;Jackie changed more during the year after Ari died than at any other time I knew her.&#x201d; At least in part, Jackie was simply reacting that year to events beyond her control, but that gut-wrenching interval would lead her into another world. After enduring the public ordeal of Ari&#x2019;s funeral in Greece, Jackie&#x2019;s conflicts with Ari&#x2019;s daughter, Christina, and her efforts to reach a financial settlement with the Onassis estate became the subject of much tabloid speculation. In April <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> reported that Ari had been planning to divorce Jackie in the months before he died and that Christina felt great bitterness toward her former stepmother, a story that circulated widely but was later denied by Christina in the <i>Times</i> at Jackie&#x2019;s request.<br>The supposed conflict between Christina and Jackie was apparently exaggerated, though there was surely no great affection between them while their lawyers negotiated a settlement of the Onassis inheritance. The photographer Marc Riboud, a friend of Jackie&#x2019;s, later described one occasion during which he saw no sign of hostility between them. &#x201c;Once I was visiting Jackie in her New York apartment, after Ari Onassis died, when all the papers were full of stories about a fight between Jackie and Christina Onassis. Christina unexpectedly dropped in, and I tried to excuse myself, but Jackie said, &#x2018;Oh, no, stay and we&#x2019;ll have a good time.&#x2019; She and Christina sat there telling stories about Ari and laughing together. They certainly were not fighting.&#x201d;<br>Jackie remained publicly mum on the subject. A close friend of Jackie&#x2019;s at the time, Cheray Duchin (now known as Cheray Zauderer Duchin Hodyes), the first wife of society bandleader Peter Duchin, blamed the Onassis camp for Jackie&#x2019;s travails, saying, &#x201c;Nobody gave her a chance to grieve because the nastiness kept pouring out.&#x201d;<br>While picking up the pieces and avoiding the media as much as possible, Jackie soon fell back into her familiar Manhattan routines. Caroline, then seventeen years old, was planning to go to London to take art courses at Sotheby&#x2019;s, while fourteen-year-old John, the last member of the Kennedy family to have Secret Service protection, was attending Collegiate, a school on the city&#x2019;s Upper West Side. With her children requiring fewer hours of attention, Jackie had time on her hands.<br>One morning, as she jogged through Central Park, wearing her customary blue jogging suit and white running shoes, she was accosted by a reporter and asked for an interview. She stopped only long enough to put him off, explaining, &#x201c;My life is very dull right now. I&#x2019;m doing just very ordinary everyday things. Really, my life at the moment would make very uninteresting reading. Do you think it would be of much interest for anyone to know that I go shopping at the local A&amp;P?&#x201d; Jackie added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m going to be watched closely for the next year or so. Maybe people will find out what Jackie is really like and write something different for a change.&#x201d;<br>Jackie had her share of detractors who added gratuitous insult to injury, including Truman Capote, with whom she had had a falling-out after he published his &#x201c;Ladies Who Lunch&#x201d; short story installments in <i>Esquire,</i> excerpts from his book <i>Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel</i> (published posthumously in 1987). Capote heaped ridicule on Jackie: &#x201c;And, in life, that is how she struck me&#x2014;not as a bona fide woman, but as an artful female impersonator impersonating Mrs. Kennedy.&#x201d; Capote also disparaged Jackie for treating her friends &#x201c;like red rubber balls&#x2014;playing with them, rolling them into obscurity, and then exclaiming six months later, &#x2018;Oh, I&#x2019;ve missed you.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br>The distinguished author and attorney Louis Auchincloss, with the advantage of having known his stepcousin since he was young, explained, &#x201c;I have some reason to suspect that Jackie was a person of peculiarly visual memory. I believe with her it was a case of out of sight being literally out of mind. If she had chanced on me in Washington, she might well have exclaimed, &#x2018;Where have you been?... Why don&#x2019;t you come around?&#x2019; I have heard other people complain of being forgotten or dropped by Jackie, and I think this may well have been the reason.&#x201d;<br>During this down period, as she tried to come to terms with her losses, grieving for Jack again as well as for Ari, she was visiting a shiatsu-acupuncturist, Lillian Biko, and a psychoanalyst, Nadine Eisman. Biko later told <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, &#x201c;Jackie&#x2019;s tension is the result of her anxiety. She has problems because she&#x2019;s so secretive. Which is why she sees me.&#x201d; While secrecy and enforced discretion were no doubt part of her defensive armature, Jackie was reexamining herself as never before and assessing her options with an eye to her future.<br>Two years earlier, while married to Onassis, she had considered taking on a TV project for NBC, when the network offered her a half million dollars to anchor a show about the endangered art treasures of Venice and Angkor Wat. Jackie was tempted, but Onassis reportedly dissuaded her with the imperious dictum, &#x201c;No Greek wife works.&#x201d; After some heated discussion, sensitive to Onassis&#x2019;s failing health and not wishing to provoke more acrimony than already existed between them, she gave up on the idea. Still, the desire to find creative outlets would stay with her, though it was mostly stifled until Ari was gone.<br>Aware that Jackie was floundering that summer, Letitia (Tish) Baldrige, who had served as social secretary for the former First Lady, suggested the idea of pursuing a career as a way for her to lift her spirits and challenge herself. Baldrige, then running a public relations firm in Manhattan, told <i>The</i> <i>New York Times,</i> &#x201c;I really felt she needed something to get out in the world and meet people doing interesting things, use that energy and that good brain of hers. I suggested publishing. Viking was my publisher, and I said to her, &#x2018;Look, you know Tommy Guinzburg&#x2014;why don&#x2019;t you talk to him?&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br>At an afternoon tea with Baldrige, Jackie initially responded to the idea of entering the workforce with lighthearted skepticism, &#x201c;Who, me&#x2014;work?&#x201d; But by the fall of 1975, she was seriously contemplating the prospect of embarking on a career. Baldrige later said, &#x201c;Jackie reached that moment every woman reaches when she needs to get involved, to put her mind to work.&#x201d; Hardboiled journalist Jimmy Breslin offered his outspoken advice to her: &#x201c;You should work as an editor. What do you think you&#x2019;re going to do, attend openings for the rest of your life?&#x201d;<br>Jackie had known publisher Thomas Guinzburg for at least twenty years. At Yale, he roomed in the same hall as Jackie&#x2019;s stepbrother, Hugh D. Auchincloss. Guinzburg had been part of the original <i>Paris Review</i> circle in the 1950s, a group that included George Plimpton and Peter Matthiessen, and he later inherited Viking Press from his father, Harold K. Guinzburg. While Tom Guinzburg was initially &#x201c;thunderstruck&#x201d; by the prospect of having Jackie join his house, he discussed the idea of her becoming an editor over lunch one afternoon at Manhattan&#x2019;s Le P�rigord. By the end of their meeting, they agreed the discussions would continue.<br>Viking was not the only publishing house that Jackie approached. A former editorial director at Random House, Jason Epstein, wrote in his memoir, <i>Eating,</i> &#x201c;One day Jackie Onassis called me to ask if she could take me to lunch at Lut�ce. We met a week or so later.... My friend Pete Hamill, who had once taken Jackie out, said it was like &#x2018;taking King Kong to the beach.&#x2019;... We took a table upstairs, in one of the small rooms, and ordered shad roe, the first of the season. She asked if there was a job for her at Random House. She wanted to be an editor.... However, there was a problem. Entry-level editorial jobs were scarce and much in demand.... I told Jackie that I believed she would take the job seriously, be a good colleague, and learn the ropes easily. But I also told her that we would have to create an opening for her, and this might not be fair to the assistants. Before I could ask her to let me talk it over with my colleagues, she said that she understood my problem and didn&#x2019;t want to impose.&#x201d;<br>Reminiscing wistfully, Tom Guinzburg told me, &#x201c;I have a favorite anecdote. During that summer before she came to work, I was sitting with Jackie at her apartment on Fifth Avenue. Caroline was coming in from one school or another, and Jackie went to answer the phone. And Caroline said to me&nbsp;... &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not true, is it, that my mother&#x2019;s gonna come and work with you in the publishing thing?&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I think it is true, I hope it&#x2019;s true. You ought to talk about it with her yourself.&#x2019; She just looked at me with contempt, the disdain of a teenager, and said, &#x2018;But what&#x2019;s she going to <i>do</i>?&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br>It was a fair question, and an ambivalent Jackie mulled it over at length. Guinzburg told her, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not really equipped to be an editor. It&#x2019;s not that you don&#x2019;t have the talent for it, the ability for it, but you don&#x2019;t have the background and the training and you, I think, would suffer in a publishing house because that would set up some kind of competitive atmosphere with the other editors. But what you can do is to be a consulting editor&nbsp;... somebody who doesn&#x2019;t have what we call line responsibilities, they&#x2019;re not assigned books, they don&#x2019;t even have necessarily to work out of the office. Their primary job is to acquire books.&#x201d; Guinzburg said, &#x201c;I then explained to her that as she became more familiar with publishing procedures, she could work on the books and with the writers to whatever extent appealed to her. She could create books and so on.&#x201d;<br>Characterizing Jackie&#x2019;s na�vet� about the then male-dominated business world, Tish Baldrige told <i>People</i> magazine, &#x201c;Jackie was not a feminist. Now, she might have had feminist leanings without really knowing it.... She never had to fight for anything in a man&#x2019;s world. It would never have occurred to her to question why there wasn&#x2019;t a woman on a board of directors.&#x201d;<br>Betty Friedan characterized Jackie as &#x201c;a closet feminist.&#x201d; Gloria Steinem likewise felt that Jackie&#x2019;s sympathies were on the side of the emerging women&#x2019;s movement, if only privately. &#x201c;One doesn&#x2019;t have to act in public to be a feminist. Wherever Jackie was, she definitely spoke in her own voice. She was warm, funny, loyal and a great girlfriend in the best sense. I think she just found public life too shallow, simpleminded, intrusive, too likely to make her&#x2014;and others&#x2014;into symbols rather than real and nuanced people.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she used men as beards or worked through them, but rather found them amusing companions&#x2014;in somewhat the way worldly men find women to be. One key is probably her father, &#x2018;Black Jack&#x2019; Bouvier. By most accounts, she adored him, and he adored her, [and] confid[ed] in her which mothers of her classmates he had affairs with. Perhaps this gave her a view of sexuality that wasn&#x2019;t so dependent on loyalty or singularity in the way that, say, friendship was loyal. I&#x2019;ve always hoped and assumed&#x2014;based on no evidence&#x2014;that she had affairs before and after her marriage, too, and possibly during (though certainly not on Jack&#x2019;s scale). In any case, I don&#x2019;t believe she saw Jack&#x2019;s affairs as threatening to her or to their permanency in each other&#x2019;s lives.<br>&#x201c;I doubt this was her mother&#x2019;s attitude about her father&#x2019;s affairs&#x2014;but then, her mother was a much more conventional woman. This was symbolized to me by the fact that she once said, according to Jackie, &#x2018;The trouble with you, Jackie, is you never play bridge with your bridesmaids.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br>Steinem added, &#x201c;As a very small and utterly unsexual example of Jackie&#x2019;s attitude, she once seated me next to Onassis at a small dinner in New York, because, as she said, &#x2018;You will disagree with him, and that will keep him interested and amused.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br>One of Jackie&#x2019;s former editorial colleagues, author Harriet Rubin, offered another interpretive spin, suggesting that she &#x201c;found, I think, a better strategy than feminism&#x2019;s defiance and insistence on a woman&#x2019;s voice being heard. Jackie didn&#x2019;t practice defiance but rather besting the existing order. She didn&#x2019;t confront men and injustice. She was a student of the eighteenth-century Frenchwomen salonistes who advanced revolutionary principles through conversation and wit. She didn&#x2019;t stand alone but allied herself with powerful men and had her say through them, sort of like a master puppeteer. In the eighties, we feminists considered Gloria Steinem brilliant for speaking in her own voice. Jackie did not speak in her own voice, ...</p><h2>Elementary Geometry for Teachers</h2><p>I learned much from this math book, I hope you do too!</p><p></p><h2>The Ayn Rand Lexicon by Rand, Ayn (1986) Hardcover</h2><p>A prolific writer, bestselling novelist, and world-renowned philosopher, Ayn Rand defined a full system of thought--from epistemology to aesthetics.

I don&#x2019;t, I mean, I don&#x2019;t personally hate cats, but I understand how a person could. I think everyone needs to have a cause, so for some people it is hating cats, and that&#x2019;s fine. Each person needs to have his or her thing that they must do. Furthermore, they shouldn&#x2019;t tell anyone else about it. They should keep it completely secret, as much as possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> At my last school no one believed me about my dad&#x2019;s lighter. I always keep it with me. It&#x2019;s the only thing I have from him. And every time someone touches it there is less of him on it. His corpse is actually on it&#x2014;I mean, not his death corpse, but his regular one, the body that falls off us all the time. It&#x2019;s what I have left of him, and I treasure it.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, I said, many times I said it, don&#x2019;t touch this lighter or I will kill you. I think because I am a girl people thought I didn&#x2019;t mean it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Someone told me they read in a book that a scientist saw a chimpanzee using sign language on a tree. Apparently the chimpanzee had learned sign language, and then it decided to use the sign language&#x2014;and it used it on a tree. The amazing thing is, the story ends there. They made the chimp use it with researchers and such&#x2014;no sign language with trees. I am completely against this sort of thing, and not because I think trees talk or anything&#x2014;don&#x2019;t worry, I am very clear-sighted. But still, I bet&#x2014;you let this chimp talk to the trees and a decade later, well, you don&#x2019;t know what happens, but that&#x2019;s the point. <br> &nbsp;<br> What I mean is, I have my own plans, my own ideas. Being kicked out of my last school&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t really affect them. I guess I don&#x2019;t really care which school I go to. But, I am sorry that I only grazed his neck with the pencil. I thought I could do better than that. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was a pretty ugly scene. They had me sitting there in the principal&#x2019;s room, with my poor aunt next to me (I live with my aunt&#x2014;dad = dead, mom in lunatic house) and across from us the principal, and Joe Schott, and his dad and mom. His dad owns a car dealership, which means that everyone respects him, though I don&#x2019;t know why. For instance, the workers at the deli call him <i>boss </i>even though he isn&#x2019;t their boss. I&#x2019;ve seen it happen. <br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, the secretary was there too, taking notes. The secretary is also the gym teacher, and I hate him, so, basically, apart from my aunt, a room full of enemies. <br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t lost on me that the principal sat with the Schotts. They started it out in the worst way. The principal said to the secretary, are we ready to begin, and then it was, yes, I think so. <br> &nbsp;<br> Schott senior said something like, Lucia, we are ready to forgive you, with this horrible expression on his face, and then Joe said, I won&#x2019;t forgive the bitch. I&#x2019;m going to miss at least two games, and then Schott senior put his hand on Joe&#x2019;s shoulder and started to say something, but the principal cut him off&#x2014;he said, hold on, let&#x2019;s let her go first. Lucia, are you ready to begin? Do you have something to say? <br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s when I said, your little prince basketball hero shouldn&#x2019;t have touched my lighter. Then I wouldn&#x2019;t have put a pencil in his neck. <br> &nbsp;<br> Well, they didn&#x2019;t like that. Joe Schott is very admired in those parts, the town darling.

I know because a girl I was in study hall with went back there with him (he is good-looking). She is awful also, so I wish them well. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Lucia, </i>if you are going to stay at this school, you must apologize to Joe and to his family. <br> &nbsp;<br> I am sorry, I said, that I wasn&#x2019;t clearer. Don&#x2019;t touch my fucking zippo, Joe. Eventually, these people are all going to go away and you&#x2019;ll be left alone. Do you understand? <br> &nbsp;<br> My aunt squeezed my leg, so I didn&#x2019;t say everything I wanted to. <br> &nbsp;<br> She is really nice. I mean, my aunt is one of the kindest people in the world, I think. She must be. When we got back to the house, she said she was sorry that things had happened that way, with my dad dying, and with my mom going away, but that stabbing somebody wouldn&#x2019;t fix it. She understood the sentiment, she did. Also, she didn&#x2019;t care that I couldn&#x2019;t go back to that school. She would find another school that would take me. The thing she was most glad about was: the police weren&#x2019;t involved. Probably the school had wanted to avoid a scandal. But, a person only gets so many chances.</p><h2>Guru Rinpoche: His Life and Times (Tsadra)</h2><p>To Tibetan Buddhists, Guru Rinpoche is a Buddha. This book recounts Guru Rinpoche's historic visit to Tibet and explains his continuing significance to Buddhists. In doing so, it illustrates how a country whose powerful armies overran the capital of China and installed a puppet emperor came to abandon its aggressive military campaigns: this transformation was due to Guru Rinpoche, who tamed and converted Tibet to Buddhism and thereby changed the course of Asian history. <br><br>Four very different Tibetan accounts of his story are presented: one by Jamgon Kongtrul; one according to the pre-Buddhist Tibetan religion B�n, by Jamyang Kyentse Wongpo; one based on Indian and early Tibetan historical documents, by Taranata; and one by Dorje Tso. In addition, there are supplications by Guru Rinpoche and visualizations to accompany them by Jamgon Kongtrul. <br><br> <i>Guru Rinpoche</i> is part of The Tsadra Foundation series published by Snow Lion Publications. The Tsadra Foundation takes its inspiration from the nineteenth-century nonsectarian Tibetan scholar and meditation master Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye, and is named after his hermitage in eastern Tibet, Tsadra Rinchen Drak. The Foundation's programs reflect his values of excellence in both scholarship and contemplative practice, and a recognition of their mutual complementarity.</p><p>Soonafter I encountered Tibetan Buddhism, I became convinced that my teacher Kalu Rinpoche&#39;, was Guru Rinpoche&#39; incarnate. This did not represent a thoughtful conclusion on my part; it was an emotional response to what I perceived to be his character and impact on my life. Such impressions are entirely personab others felt his presence more evocative of bodhisattvas such as Great Compassion or Tara, whose meditations he taught worldwide; or of the great yogis Milarepa or Tang-Tong Gyalpo, whose lives he emulated. There is no right or wrong in these perceptions; they inform and enliven our faith. My appreciation of my teacher as Guru Rinpoche&#39;, while an entirely personal and perhaps unreasonable conclusion, has stayed with me to the present day and explains much of this book. During periods of retreat, I searched for prayers to Guru Rinpoche&#39; and found the text of Sup plications to Guru Rinpoche&#39; in Seven Chapters, which quickly became a treasured companion, as have many diverse versions of Guru Rinpoche&#39;s life story. My discovery that Tibetan accounts of their first major Buddhist master are not free from contradictions has not dampened my enjoyment of them. If nothing else, my life with Tibetan lamas has proved to be a rich education in de-structuring and widening my imagination of enlightenment or enlightened beings, beginning with Guru Rinpoche&#39;. I am pleased to have the opportunity to share with non-Tibetan readers these stories and supplications. To them I have added some information concerning the Buddhist view of history, and a few relevant details of India, China, and Tibet&#39;s life during that era. I have lived in India for five years and in Taiwan for three, and I am always immersed in the Tibetan world, which no longer has borders to restrict it. I deeply appreciate all three cultures and hope to show how they intersected in surprising ways before and during Guru Rinpoche&#39;s fateful visit to Tibet. Finally, I observe with immense happiness the coming of Guru Rinpoche&#39; to new lands, particularly the wild West, my birthplace. Buddhism is still in its infancy outside Asia, yet it has already had a major impact on many people&#39;s lives. We cannot measure Buddhism&#39;s development in new environments by its acquisition of land, bricks, and mortai, but by changes in our minds, lifestyle, and deathstyle. Such changes take time. Yet where once Guru Rinpoche&#39; seemed an impossibly inscrutable foreigner, he is now coming into clear focus. I hope that this book will contribute to this process.Ngawang Zangpo (Hugh Leslie Thompson) completed two three-year retreats under the direction of the late Kalu Rinpoche. He is presently working on a number of translation projects under the direction of Chadral Rinpoche and Lama Tharchin Rinpoche. He has also contributed to Kalu Rinpoche's translation group's books <i>Myriad Worlds </i>and <i>Buddhist Ethics</i>.</p><h2>The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon)</h2><p><p><b>MORE THAN 80 MILLION COPIES SOLD<br><br><b><b>Nominated as one of America&#x2019;s best-loved novels by PBS&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Great American Read</i></b></b></b><br><br>While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2014;clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.</p><p>Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion&#x2014;a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci&#x2014;and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle&#x2014;while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move&#x2014;the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</p></p><p>With <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> Dan Brown masterfully concocts an intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating esoteria culled from 2,000 years of Western history. <p> A murder in the silent after-hour halls of the Louvre museum reveals a sinister plot to uncover a secret that has been protected by a clandestine society since the days of Christ. The victim is a high-ranking agent of this ancient society who, in the moments before his death, manages to leave gruesome clues at the scene that only his granddaughter, noted cryptographer Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a famed symbologist, can untangle. The duo become both suspects and detectives searching for not only Neveu's grandfather's murderer but also the stunning secret of the ages he was charged to protect. Mere steps ahead of the authorities and the deadly competition, the mystery leads Neveu and Langdon on a breathless flight through France, England, and history itself. Brown (<i>Angels and Demons</i>) has created a page-turning thriller that also provides an amazing interpretation of Western history. Brown's hero and heroine embark on a lofty and intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail. Though some will quibble with the veracity of Brown's conjectures, therein lies the fun. <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>"Dan Brown has to be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the country.

They know that they're certain to encounter the same petty thefts and confidence tricksters they're used to dealing with, though they hope identifying the culprits among the 500 or so passengers will prove a little easier than it does aboard the great 2,000 passenger Cunard ships. <br><br>Their hope is misplaced, however, and they soon settle in to the routine of taking reports from agitated passengers and doing their best to recover whatever stolen jewelry or purloined cash the unfortunate travelers are missing. The cruise is certain to be unique in at least one respect, however: the Duke and Duchess of Fife, along with their two small children, are aboard, and the detectives' secondary task is to keep an eye on the royals and do their best to ensure their security.<br><br>When a dead body turns up, however, George and Genevieve know they've got their work cut out for them. Suspects abound, and on such a small ship keeping the demise of the poor victim a secret is proving tougher than they'd like. Through the eyes of Conrad Allen, a luxury cruise to Egypt in 1908 becomes a majestic voyage, albeit with murder in the mix, upon which readers will be eager to embark.<br></p><p><b>Conrad Allen</b> is the author of four previous oceanliner mysteries, most recently <i>Murder on the Caronia</i>.<br>The Marmora, a small luxury ocean liner en route from England to Australia via Cairo in 1908, serves as the venue for Allen's fifth lighthearted historical (after 2003's Murder on the Caronia) to feature private detectives George Porter Dillman and Genevieve Masefield. The sleuthing pair are acting as unofficial bodyguards to the Duke and Duchess of Fife and their children, but they also have reason to keep an eye on a slew of other first-class passengers, including a noted Egyptologist traveling with his musical daughter and a strongbox of artifacts, an urbane investor in a Cairo hotel project, an attractive American widow and her sulky daughter and a boastful French chef with constant complaints about the food. A series of jewel and antiques thefts, as well as a ghastly murder that the ship's authorities take great care to cover up, propels the plot at a stately pace. To complicate matters, Genevieve to her horror sees her former lover on board with his new bride. The happily-ever-after ending and the picture of gracious living during an era when security was of relatively little concern should please mystery readers seeking purely escapist fare. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Almost as soon as his lungs fill with the humid Caribbean air, Swagger regrets accepting this assignment. Not only must he contend with posturing, backstabbing U.S. intelligence agents, but Boss Harry proves to be both incautiously lustful (forcing Earl to rescue him from a Havana brothel confrontation) and a big target for mobsters who don't want American politicians or anyone else upsetting the profitable criminal equilibrium of Batista-era Cuba. Swagger exacerbates the risk to his longevity by agreeing to help the U.S. government assassinate Cuba's revolutionary darling of the moment, Fidel Castro--a task that will pit this Arkansas lawman against a disenchanted Russian killer who's been charged with protecting and mentoring the 26-year-old agitator.</p><p> Given Swagger's well-established weaponry skills, it's hardly surprising that <i>Havana</i> is peppered with tightly choreographed shootouts, both on dusty country roads and in a Zanja Street porno theater full of moaning patrons. That's the male fantasy part; this novel's literary inclination shows in its portrayal of Havana as a richly decadent city full of shiny-fendered Cadillacs, jaded whores, and casinos flushing money onto Florida-bound boats. While Ernest Hemingway and mob boss Meyer Lansky make cameo appearances here, only Castro leaves much of an impression, whether he's bumbling through an attack on a military barracks or defending himself against a father who thinks him lazy, vain, and "womanly" ("I am between opportunities, but I swear to you, I am a man of destiny"). Although Swagger's climactic gunfight tests the limits of credibility, <i>Havana</i> remains an unusually substantive page-turner, expertly blending hostilities with humor and heart. <i>--J.

National ad/promo.</p><p><p><strong>David Lavender</strong> is the author of more than two dozen books on the West, among them <em>Bent's Fort, California: Land of New Beginnings, Westward Vision:</em> <em>The Story of the Oregon Trail, The Southwest, </em>and <em>The Way to the Western Sea:</em> <em>Lewis and Clark Across the Continent.</em></p>Lavender, a prolific historian of the West (The Way to the Western Sea, 1988, etc.), offers a tragic tale of a Native American tribe's loss of its land, culture, and identity. The 1877 flight of the Nez Perc&#x201a; is one of the most famous and mournful episodes in the long history of Indian disenfranchisement. For three and a half months and 1700 miles, they managed to elude General O.O. Howard in an escape from their Pacific Northwest homelands, only to be overtaken a mere two days' ride from safety in Canada. During that time, white Americans came to admire the tribe's Chief Joseph as a master orator and military tactician who continually managed to outfox his pursuers. Here, Lavender sees the flight of the Nez Perc&#x201a; as the culmination of the tribe's more than 75 years of encounters with whites, including Lewis and Clark, British and American fur traders, missionaries, miners, farmers, Indian agents, and federal troops. In the process, the Nez Perc&#x201a; were buffeted by outside forces--horses, guns, diseases, material goods they badly wanted but could scarcely afford--that filled them with doubt about their traditional guardian spirits (wayakins). Yet, Lavender says, the major mistake this peaceful, much put-upon people made was to believe the US government's promise that treaties guaranteed their right to the land of their fathers. As sympathetic as Lavender is to the Nez Perc&#x201a;, though, he is careful not to make exaggerated claims for them. For instance, he shows that General Howard invented Chief Joseph's skill as a wily military genius in order to excuse the general's own bumbling pursuit of the tribe. A powerful lament for a tribe that illustrates, as Lavender says, ``the infinite sadness of a race's defeat and death.''

Morgan's Texas-born mother Tanya, a nurse and devoted wife, pulled up stakes with her grieving husband Jim, and moved on. It was the best way to put the past behind them. Until their son Michael, a boy who by all accounts was terrified of his mother, began showing signs of the same affliction that stole the life of his baby sister...<br><br>First, the suspicion: Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Then, Tanya was charged and convicted with felony child abuse of her son. She was later tried and ultimately convicted for first degree murder of Morgan.

She was not unattractive, though neither was she gorgeous. She was a woman with the kind of looks that either went unnoticed or sparked a person&#x2019;s memory of someone else. Tanya&#x2019;s tiny nose at times seemed too small to hold the bridge of her oval-shaped eyeglass frames; her brown hair was of a sensible cut, the kind that takes only a minute to shampoo and just a few more to brush out. It was the look of a woman with plenty to do.<br>Of course, Tanya could dress up. And when she was in one of her skinnier cycles, she looked pretty good.<br>But mostly, with her well-trod sneakers and car crammed with kid stuff, Tanya looked exactly like what she was: a busy wife, a caring mother.<br>When she flew from Amarillo to Des Moines, Iowa, to join her husband Jim at a Holiday Inn, she had paid a little extra attention to her hair and makeup. She wanted to look nice for Jim. Reunions were important to Tanya Reid.<br>In what had become a cruel merry-go-round in the era of corporate takeovers and mergers, the Reid family was moving again. In the three years since their baby&#x2019;s death, the Reids had lived in Hereford, Texas, returned to the Chicago area, and gone back to Texas&#x2014;this time, Amarillo. They knew the drill&#x2014;Jim went ahead, while Tanya spiffed the house for real estate agents and packed the cartons for the movers.<br>It was the last week of May 1987.<br>Jim had been transferred again by Swift Independent, the meatpacking giant that had employed him since he was a teenager working himself through school. If Tanya wasn&#x2019;t happy about the move because she would rather have stayed closer to Dumas, her husband was decidedly and justifiably bitter. His pay had been cut in Texas and his responsibilities reduced. What could he expect in Iowa, where he was told he&#x2019;d be working evenings? It had been years since he worked nights. But what choice did he have? He needed the job to keep the health insurance for his children. The Reids had been boxed into a take-it-or-leave-it situation. He swore that once they were settled, he&#x2019;d look for a new position in the industry.<br>Tanya had come to Iowa to find a suitable place to live for six-year-old Carolyn and two-year-old Brandon Michael, a good school, and a doctor who could keep watch over the boy. Michael had suffered from repeated apnea&#x2014;episodes during which his breathing abruptly stopped&#x2014;and some seizures of an undetermined cause. The health of the Reids&#x2019; children was always on their minds.<br>On the morning of May 28, Tanya and Jim arrived for an appointment with pediatric neurologist Thomas Kelly. The doctor, a soft-spoken, gentle sort with a drawn face set off by the sparkle of eyeglasses, listened intently to the sad story of the couple&#x2019;s beloved baby Morgan and how she had died of SIDS. Tanya said postmortem testing had determined that Morgan had Fragile X Syndrome, a genetic defect sometimes linked to retardation, though primarily in boys. Tanya explained how at one time she believed she was a carrier for Fragile X, but that followup testing had proved negative. And while the information was interesting to the neurologist, he knew of no studies suggesting a link between SIDS and Fragile X.<br>Both parents were concerned that Michael was suffering from problems similar to those of the sister who had died fifteen months before his birth.<br>Tanya did most of the talking. The twenty-nine-year-old mother rattled off the names and dates of medical procedures her son had endured. She provided the information in an extremely clear, ordered fashion. Her chronology left nothing out, so there was no need to backtrack on a point missed along the way. That she was able to do so could not have been a surprise. Not only was she the boy&#x2019;s mother, she also told Dr. Kelly she was a trained nurse.<br>Amid the medical diatribe was good news. Thankfully, Michael had not had any apnea episodes for a while. He was no longer on seizure medications&#x2014;dosages of Tegretol, pheno-barbital, Dilantin had all been discontinued by April. He had been off a home apnea monitor since December of 1986.<br>Dr. Kelly took a single page of notes and told the Reids he was looking forward to taking care of their son&#x2019;s neurological problems. For regular pediatric care, the neurologist gave Tanya and Jim the name Dr. Leonard Gangeness, a pediatrician nearing retirement whom some young residents had fondly nicknamed &#x201c;Old Bear.&#x201d;<br>During the mornings of that week in late May, Tanya scouted the area for a house while her husband was at work, getting up to speed on his new job. Since the Reids would be taking a financial hit with the sale of the house in Amarillo, they quickly decided houses in suburban Des Moines were too expensive, beyond a practical reach.<br>Jim and Tanya found an apartment in Urbandale, one of Des Moines&#x2019;s bedroom communities. The complex was located near the Sherwood Forest Shopping Center&#x2014;one of those pseudo-Tudor developments more akin to a bargain-basement Disneyland than a replica of Merry Olde England. The massive maze of apartments and town houses called Nottingham Square was built on an incline overlooking the Kmart on Hickman Road. The units, clustered in groups of six, were painted gray and beige and trimmed in dark timbers. Each apartment had two floors, cut-loop carpeting, a balcony, and a patio. Some had views of the back side of the Kmart. And during springtime, and sometimes into summer, the cloying scent of blooming lilacs hung in the moist air like damp clothing on a line.<br>Tanya liked the fact that Nottingham Square was close to the grade school, and that it appeared many of the families who lived there had young children. She thought the apartment itself was adequate, though a lot smaller than the homes they had owned in Texas and Illinois. When one became available, they planned to move into one of the roomier town houses.<br>It didn&#x2019;t matter much, though; neither husband nor wife planned on staying in Des Moines very long.<br>This was not going to be home.<br>BACK IN Texas, good-byes and unfinished business were in order.<br>On June 27, before leaving for Iowa, Tanya Reid carried her son into a pediatric clinic in Amarillo. Not only did he have a sore throat, but the second toe on Michael&#x2019;s right foot was infected. Tanya told the doctor her little boy had &#x201c;stubbed his toe.&#x201d; The two-year-old&#x2019;s toenail was removed and antibiotics were prescribed for the infection.<br>Tanya Thaxton Reid had always been close to her parents and three sisters. She was tearful when it came time to say good-bye. Her mother, Wanda, wasn&#x2019;t entirely pleased with her daughter&#x2019;s move either. Tanya was her baby girl, and she liked having her close to home. Since John Thaxton&#x2019;s business was now headquartered in Amarillo, sometimes before work John and Wanda would stop by the Reids&#x2019; house for coffee. That could be no more. Everyone understood Jim had no choice but to accept the position. But no one had to be happy about it.<br>Iowa seemed like a million miles away from the Panhandle.<br>&#x201c;I really was not averse to going to Des Moines,&#x201d; Tanya insisted years later. &#x201c;It was a big enough town; I could continue my nursing degree. Yes, I would miss my folks, but they could come up and visit and I could go down to see them, too.&#x201d;<br>Jim flew back to Texas to escort his wife and children as they drove north. Carolyn and Michael took turns riding with their mother or father. Tanya drove her car, an &#x2019;85 blue Cutlass Ciera, and Jim&#x2019;s Ford pickup pulled a boat. Michael was quiet, but Carolyn jabbered all the way to Iowa.<br>The Reids moved into apartment #122 at 7400 Canterbury Road on July 1. Two days later, Tanya carried Michael into the emergency room at Iowa Methodist Medical Center. It was late afternoon, around four-thirty. The little boy had had a fever since eight-thirty that morning. The mother told the ER staff about her son&#x2019;s history of seizures and her concern that something could be happening to Michael. He wasn&#x2019;t eating, and had, in fact, vomited. His temperature was 103 upon admission by Dr. Leonard Gangeness. A young intern named Robert Colman also examined the boy. A blood workup was ordered, chest X rays were taken, urine was analyzed, and the boy underwent a thorough physical examination. He was healthy except for the toe and the fever. He slept well through the night.<br>The Fourth of July holiday for Tanya and her son was spent at the hospital. Since Michael wasn&#x2019;t eating, IVs were continued. He vomited again, late in the afternoon, but slept well that night.<br>The next day was a repeat of the previous one, though Tanya was able to get her son to eat some solid food.<br>By the third day in the hospital, the boy&#x2019;s temperature was normal and his elevated white blood cell count had dropped. Michael was released. Tanya carried her son, along with a little pink bottle of the antibiotic amoxicillin and a slip of paper with Dr. Gangeness&#x2019;s phone number to confirm a follow-up visit in a couple of days.<br>NEVER ONE to make friends easily, Tanya spent much of her days isolated in her apartment. Sure, she had the kids, and granted, her husband did come home after work, but for someone who loved to talk as much as she, having no adult ears around during the day was unbearable.<br>She and her sisters and mother kept in constant contact by telephone, but that could only ease the boredom to a point. Tanya needed some new friends. She could do it, all right. She had done it before.<br>According to her oldest sister, Beverly Kay, Tanya had to &#x201c;teach herself to be outgoing.&#x201d;<br>One way to meet friends was to hang around the pool at Nottingham Square and engage other stay-at-home moms in conversation. But Tanya&#x2019;s initial poolside efforts proved futile. She tried to befriend women who had their own lives, own friends. None had time for the talkative gal from the Panhandle.<br></p><h2>Wonders of Italy</h2><p>From the natural splendors of the Bel Paese--beautiful country--to the manmade treasures of art and architecture, this oversize, exquisitely illustrated volume captures the irresistible magic of Italia.

Morris PHD, perhaps best known for leading expeditions to Mt. Ararat in search of Noah's Ark, received his Doctorate in Geological Engineering at the University of Oklahoma in 1980. He served on the University of Oklahoma faculty before joining the Institute for Creation Research in 1984. Dr. Morris held the position of Professor of Geology and was appointed President in 1996. He continues to serve ICR as President Emeritus. He traveled widely around the world speaking at churches, conferences, schools, and scientific meetings. Dr. Morris has written numerous books and articles on the scientific evidence that supports the Bible. Dr. Morris is the author or co-author of such books as The Young Earth, The Modern Creation Trilogy, The Fossil Record: Unearthing Nature's History of Life, The Global Flood: Unlocking Earth's Geologic History, and Noah's Ark: Adventures on Ararat. He is also a contributor to Guide to Creation Basics and Creation Basics &amp; Beyond. I believe that people who are involved in teaching children the basic principles of Christianity must always focus on the inerrancy of the Bible. Satan has used the lies and false assumptions of the Theory of Evolution to attack Christianity in many ways. Many public schools teach the Theory of Evolution as the absolute Law of Evolution. The Global Flood gives solid geological evidence that the Theory of Evolution and the billions of years old age of the earth are wrong. I use The Global Flood regularly in teaching children, teens, and adults. Even though The Global Flood was written for adults I have found that with a little help sharp 10 year old children understand and benefit from The Global Flood. My husband recently helped me to lead an 86 year old to make a decision for Christ using The Global Flood. I recommend buying, reading, and giving The Global Flood. .

With little of the cool irony that lit up his best work (The Money Bazaars, 1984, etc.), Mayer recounts how a celebrated trading house's fake bids in Treasury auctions enabled it to corner markets in US government obligations, squeeze short interests, and book millions in illicit profits. He goes on to offer a short-take appreciation of how Salomon Bros. (or ``Solly,'' as it's known on Wall Street) outgrew its roots and developed a dollar-denominated, anything-goes corporate culture that made involvement in a megabuck manipulation all but inevitable. Along his anecdotal way, the author puts paid to any notion that senior management had no idea a scandal was brewing--pointing out, for instance, that someone had to approve borrowing the billions required to carry the positions Solly amassed by abusing its trust as a primary dealer. Nor does Mayer spare federal authorities whose lax oversight stemmed from a different sort of hubris, exemplified by the surveillance official who assured the House Banking Committee that ``people don't lie to the FRB.'' But while the author makes market arcana comprehensible to lay readers, he's irritatingly preachy (albeit not off-base) in his deadly earnest evaluations of lawless investment's implications. On balance, though, an instructive briefing on a capital crime and its punishment. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In painstaking detail, bestselling business author Mayer ( The Bankers ) traces the spectacular rise of Wall Street's most powerful investment house and its ignominious fall in the 1991 scandal involving a $10 billion manipulation of the U.S. Treasury note and bond market. Mayer finds that Reagan-era deregulation, combined with second-generation greed and cynicism at Salomon Brothers, encouraged the development of various "bells and whistles"--investment embellishments which tended to mislead clients, disguise illegalities and obscure "terrific markups." Among those involved in this "conspiracy against the tax-paying citizenry" are such colorful characters as "Billy" Salomon and John Gutfreund. But Mayer also recounts the larger story of the evolution of finance "from a context of relationships to a context of transactions" designed for pure profit. Though some of the market complexities can occasionally make it heavy going for the general reader, this is a landmark treatment of the money world, pegged to one particularly dramatic and alarming case history. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Will to Climb: Obsession and Commitment and the Quest to Climb Annapurna--the World&#39;s Deadliest Peak</h2><p>The bestselling author of <i>No Shortcuts to the Top </i>and <i>K2</i> chronicles his three attempts to climb the world's tenth-highest and statistically deadliest peak, Annapurna in the Himalaya, while exploring the dramatic and tragic history of others who have made -- or attempted &#x2013; the ascent, and what these exploits teach us about facing life's greatest challenges.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a high school student in the flatlands of Rockford, Illinois, where the highest objects on the horizon were water towers, Ed Viesturs read and was captivated by the French climber Maurice Herzog's famous and grisly account of the first ascent of Annapurna in 1950. When he began his own campaign to climb the world's 14 highest peaks in the late 1980s, Viesturs looked forward with trepidation to undertaking Annapurna himself. Two failures to summit in 2000 and 2002 made Annapurna his nemesis. His successful 2005 ascent was the triumphant capstone of his climbing quest. In <i>The Will To Climb</i> Viesturs brings the extraordinary challenges of Annapurna to vivid life through edge-of-your-seat accounts of the greatest climbs in the mountain&#x2019;s history, and of his own failed attempts and eventual success.&nbsp; In the process he ponders what Annapurna reveals about some of our most fundamental moral and spiritual questions--questions, he believe, that we need to answer to lead our lives well.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of all fourteen of the world's highest mountains, which I climbed between 1989 and 2005," writes Viesturs, "the one that came the closest to defeating my best efforts was Annapurna.&#x201d; Although it was the first 8,000-meter peak to be climbed,&nbsp; Annapurna is not as well known as the world's highest mountain, Everest, or second highest, K2. But as Viesturs argues, Annapurna, while not technically the most difficult of the 8,000ers, is the most daunting because it has no route--no ridge or face on any side of the mountain--that is relatively free of what climbers call "objective danger"&#x2014;the threat of avalanches, above all, but also of collapsing seracs (huge ice blocks), falling rocks, and crevasses. Since its first ascent in 1950, Annapurna has been climbed by more than 130 people, but 53 have died trying. This high fatality rate makes Annapurna the most dangerous of the 8,000-meter peaks. <br>Viesturs and co-author David Roberts chronicle Ed's three attempts to climb Annapurna, as well as the attempts of others, from the two French climbers who made the landmark first ascent of Annapurna on June 3, 1950, through the daring and tragic campaigns of such world-class mountaineers as Reinhold Messner and Anatoli Boukreev. Viesturs's accounts and analyses of these extraordinary adventures serve as a point of departure for his exploration of themes vividly illustrated by Annapurna expeditions, including obsession and commitment, fear and fulfillment, failure and triumph--issues that have been neglected in the otherwise very rich literature of mountaineering, and that can inform the lives and actions of everyone.</p><p><b>Ed Viesturs</b> is the first and only American to ascend all fourteen of the world&#x2019;s 8,000-meter peaks without supplemental oxygen.

Bethany Salem blinked and shook her head, thinking that it was too hot in the huge family room of Vanessa Peters' home, or maybe she'd eaten something she shouldn't have. Food poisoning could make you hallucinate. Halloween music boomed from hidden speakers, and a bunch of kids were doing the limbo with a broom held by Wolfman and Little Bo Peep across the room. Her best friend, Tillie Alexander, plopped down beside her on the sofa, prattling about the great decorations, the fantastic catered food, and how much this party must have cost. Her gold costume shimmered and oozed in the dim lighting as she stuffed a worn deck of Tarot cards in a gold- beaded pouch. <br> <br>Bethany's mouth grew dry and her tongue felt like it was cemented to the roof of her mouth. She breathed in little gasps, her heartbeat quickening. Tillie didn't seem to notice and turned to talk to someone else, waving the gold pouch expressively in the air as she chattered. Bethany's natural vision collapsed to a pinpoint, replaced totally by some sort of psychic vision. Her fingers clawed at the neck of her costume, the orange and black sequins catching briefly under her nails, but no one noticed. It was as if a part of her floated up in the air somewhere, her mind observing a new scene in some sort of weird time lapse. She was no longer at the poshest teen Halloween party in Cedar Crest. Where was she? <br> <br>She couldn't feel her physical body anymore. The experience was like a bad horror movie, the kind where you yell at the girl on the screen to run. Except she couldn't scream. Her tongue would not obey, and there was nowhere to go. No more party. No more Tillie. She was in a surreal place where she floated freely in the air, and the man below her had a gun. <br> <br>The man raised his arm. The scene stuck, like a videotape on pause. She saw the dirt around the edges of his mouth, as if he'd just consumed a chocolate bar, but the rest of his face was obscured. A shadow? No, a mask. One of those black masks that only cover the area around the eyes and the bridge of the nose. A garish red-and-white polka dot bandanna covered his hair. He reminded her of a fat, dirty pirate, except the fat was padding, she was sure of it. <br> <br>Freeze frame. <br> <br>The woman's shocking blue eyes opened in surprise, devoid of hope. <br> <br>Paralyzed. The crack of the pistol-a hollow, elongated sound that thrummed through the air, as if the bullet passed within a millimeter of Bethany's ear as it bored straight for the woman's heart. <br> <br>The yellow wall so bright behind the falling victim; her head snapped back, arms akimbo, then folded like a wilting white poppy with a splashing, crimson center. <br> <br>Another woman, an older one with dark skin, materialized. The scene began to slip away, the edges growing fuzzy but not completely melting. The wizened figure cocked her head as the long, black tendrils of her hair glowed with white streaks, its ropy length in pieces as if she individually twirled the tresses in boredom moments before. She stared at Bethany with liquid black eyes that carried just a hint of ice blue speckling the iris. Bethany couldn't move. The killer pirate didn't move. And, obviously, the woman on the floor remained frozen in death. <br> <br>The old woman pointed a gnarled, dark finger at her own forehead, leathery with age and crisscrossed by tiny, intricate wrinkles. Slowly, a third eye appeared beneath her wavering finger. The eye shown with an inner, blue light. "You can see," said the woman. She continued to point to the third eye. "You have the gift. You must use it wisely. This is the awakening. In time your skill will grow. Don't disappoint me." <br> <br>Bethany's heart pumped an erratic momentum of blood through her veins. <br> <br>"Hey, snap out of it!" yelled Tillie over the steady cadence of music. <br> <br>Bethany jerked her head, focusing on the smiling face of her friend. She was back at the party, the murder scene gone. She sighed with relief, not realizing that she'd been holding her breath. <br> <br>"Have you been sitting here the whole time I was gone?" asked Tillie. <br> <br>Bethany opened and closed her mouth, then said, "You were gone?" <br> <br>"For about fifteen minutes, girlfriend." Tillie plopped down beside her on the couch, throwing the gold-beaded bag on the coffee table. "Glad you saved my place. Right beside the food." She smacked glossy lips. "We're supposed to be having a good time, you know," Tillie reminded her, cocking her head and dipping her dark fingers into a bowl of buttery popcorn. "What's with you? You look like you've seen a ghost or something." <br> <br>"Or something," muttered Bethany, throwing her friend a lopsided grin while trying to ignore the pounding in her temples. She took a jittery breath. Maybe she was just going plain old nuts. She examined her soda can, hoping no one slipped anything in there. Drugs were not her thing, and most of the people here were not her friends. <br> <br>Tillie pushed the bowl of popcorn toward Bethany. "Want some?" <br> <br>"Nah, I'm trying to watch my weight." <br> <br>"Yeah, right," replied Tillie. "Like you're really fat." <br> <br>Bethany narrowed her eyes. "We can't all eat like you and get away with it. Just think of my abstinence as fat prevention." <br> <br>Sidney Bluefeather, computer nerd of the century and Native American activist at Cedar Crest High, wandered over and perched on the arm of the sofa. He looked as uncomfortable as Bethany felt. His eyes scanned the crowd but his expression said he was afraid to mingle. Tonight he was dressed in full native regalia, complete with a nasty looking knife that appeared more than real. He'd actually be half- decent looking if he didn't hunch his shoulders and did something better than a ponytail with his hair. He always wore baggy clothes, like he slept in them or something. His eyes were strange, like his gene pool was touched by a Mongolian khan. Too bizarre. <br> <br>Bethany inclined her head slightly (no need to be a snob) but turned away to deter conversation. It wasn't anything personal, she just didn't feel sociable, which was stupid because that's what you were supposed to do at parties-mix and mingle. Coming here was probably a mistake. She scooted closer to Tillie to further seal the "don't talk to me" message. She wanted to tell Tillie about what just happened, but this wasn't the place to share her vision. Bethany tried to compose herself, running nervous fingers through her heavy, dark hair, then plucking at the black, silky sleeves of her witchy costume. The music was almost deafening and she was glad when, inexplicably, one of the speakers blew out, creating shouts, sparks, and squeals. Still, no one turned off the music. <br> <br>Kids milled throughout the Halloween-decorated warren of Vanessa Peters' basement family room, spilling soda, laughing, dancing, and trying to scare each other or catch a quick kiss from a willing partner. Minus one speaker, the music played on. Sidney watched the crowd with wistful eyes. Bethany could relate. She wasn't the belle of the ball either. She'd have to remind Ramona that her glamoury spell was lousy. Maybe her housekeeper should brush up on that Hoodoo-bayou stuff of hers. <br> <br>All the popular kids from Cedar Crest High were here, along with a few other, odd choices. She knew she was the latter. Sidney was another outcast and, of course, Gillian Merriday over there in the corner. All of them were outsiders, but for different reasons. <br> <br>Sidney said, "I understand that, but-" <br> <br>Bethany looked to the right. To the left. No one was around Sidney, but he kept talking quietly anyway. Weird. Bethany moved closer to Tillie. Definitely a glitch in the gene pool. <br> <br>Tillie, it appeared, decked out in gold lam� and topped with a heavy turquoise and gold collar, was the life of the party. Of course, her friend was always the life of anything-outgoing, charismatic, charming. Besides, Tillie spent the last two hours reading her Tarot cards for all the kids, cementing her place as the center of attention, at least for this evening. "How did your Tarot readings go?" asked Bethany. <br> <br>"Same old, same old. Some of them believe. Some think it's a joke. No biggie," said Tillie, flapping her hand in the air, the gold bands on her forearms gleaming in the low light. <br> <br>"Anything interesting?" asked Bethany, shifting positions on the couch. She couldn't seem to get the vision out of her head. The murder. The old woman. Maybe she'd been so bored she daydreamed it all. <br> <br>A loud burst of laughter mixed with the volume of music shrouded Tillie's reply. All Bethany heard was something about Gillian Merriday. <br> <br>"What about Gillian?" asked Bethany, leaning closer. Gillian Merriday sat in front of her in chemistry class. A big-boned girl with thick, faded brown hair and snapping gray eyes, she walked around with a chip on her shoulder the size of the Titanic. She'd been suspended twice already this year, and it was only the end of October. Other than that, Bethany didn't know much about her, nor did she care to. Look at Gillian wrong and you might find yourself with a black eye, two if she meant business-off school property, of course. Tonight she was dressed like a very large, athletic Cat Woman. The plastic toy whip in her hand was a frightening thought. <br> <br>Tillie's dark eyes narrowed. "One of those strange ones. She clammed up when I asked her about stuff at home. There were some really negative cards in there, but I wasn't sure what it was about, and there isn't much you can do when people won't open up. She's kind of snotty, so she fits in with this crowd. Her cards indicate a great talent. I've heard that she paints amazing stuff, but I've never seen it. Hope she gets over whatever it is and puts all that negative energy into her artwork," she added, waving her bangled arm in the air. "You can only go so far in a reading. The cards are tools to the subconscious. Too many people think psychics are some sort of gods that know everything, which is stupid. If that were the case, I wouldn't even need to go to school." <br> <br>"I wish I didn't have to go to school!" Bethany rolled her eyes. "I've got a calculus test next week that I'd like to avoid. You know, Gillian Merriday doesn't fit anywhere. She's absolutely violent. I was surprised to see her here. No wonder you got a bunch of rotten cards." <br> <br>Tillie shrugged. "I haven't the vaguest idea how she got invited to this party, unless Vanessa wanted to be safe, rather than sorry. Gillian sure wasn't helpful, and she's in her usual sour mood. Besides, the way she kept flicking that dumb plastic whip sort of messed up my concentration." <br> <br>"Don't worry about it. This wouldn't be the place to tell your deepest secrets," remarked Bethany, thinking of her strange vision a few moments ago. <br> <br>Tillie dipped her head. The tight black cornrows of her hair laced with strands of gold made her look like she was a queen herself, apropos since she was dressed like Cleopatra. "Yeah. Right. I see your point." Tillie dug into the bowl of popcorn. "Come on," she said, licking her fingers, "what's up? You're normally not so reserved. Get with it. This is a party!" She stood up and swiveled her gold-clad hips, then flopped back down. <br> <br>Bethany thought Sidney would tip off the end of the couch. If he could pick his tongue up off the floor she'd be surprised. Worse, he probably heard their conversation. Maybe not. It was pretty loud in here. She was glad she didn't say anything about the Witch thing. Besides, what was he to her? She suppressed a giggle at Tillie's natural exhibitionism, then shoved a torn Halloween spider decoration aside. This wasn't the time to talk about one's insecurities, or the fact that her imagination had just murdered a woman, or what might be lurking in the dark folds of Gillian Merriday's life, especially with Sidney hanging over their shoulders because he didn't have anywhere else to go. She'd save the stuff about the vision for Witches' Night Out next Thursday, when she, Tillie, and Nam got together to learn and work real magick, not that fake garbage Vanessa was trying to do over there in the corner-light as a feather, stiff as a board-geez, what kid stuff! She wanted to think about what the vision meant before she said anything to anyone. <br> <br>Bethany switched subjects. "What was Vanessa talking to you about when we first got here?" She cast her eyes briefly in the direction of the Peters girl dressed in a Marie Antoinette costume that must have cost a fortune. The girl abandoned her levitation game, engaging herself in a major flirting session with some blonde-haired guy. "She seemed pretty interested in you awhile ago." <br> <br>"What? You've been sitting here observing everybody?" Tillie shook her head and smiled. "You are your father's daughter, that's for sure! His detective mentality is rubbing off on you. Dangerous. You've got to learn not to be so intense!" She leaned back into the sofa. "There's an open spot on the winter cheer squad," explained Tillie. "Vanessa's the captain. She wanted to know if I'd like to fill the space." <br> <br>Bethany raised her eyebrows. "What about tryouts?" <br> <br>"There's only one spot. The coach doesn't want the hassle. I was a cheerleader in middle school, so it's sorta of a been-there-done-that kind of thing." <br> <br>"Do you want the spot?" <br> <br>Tillie downed another handful of popcorn. "Dunno. I don't want it to interfere with swim season. Since you've been watching everybody, where's Nam?" <br> <br>Bethany's eyes swept the ill-lit basement, past the life sized-replicas of the Mummy and Edgar Allen Poe. "Over there," she said, not wanting to point at the petite girl dressed in the leprechaun costume. "By the steps near that Frankenstein poster. Talking to the new kid. I think his name is Michael Raines." Nam's pretty, dark head was bent close to Michael's, their hair almost intertwining. Bethany felt a silly surge of jealousy and then silently reprimanded herself. Why shouldn't Nam find someone she liked? <br> <br>"Looks like an intense conversation," said Tillie. <br> <br>"Yeah." And here I sit, thought Bethany, definitely not anyone's major attraction, discounting the hovering Sidney Bluefeather, of course. <br> <br>Nam caught her eye and trailed over to the sofa, dragging Michael Raines behind her. He wasn't much taller than Nam, and was a bit on the thin side. Unlike the other guests, he wasn't in costume, as if to say that dressing up wasn't cool. He had those hooded eyes that reminded you of raw wildness. Bethany could see why her friend was so taken, in an odd sort of way, but he seemed too old for her. She'd heard he was a senior. Strange that he would be hanging with a sophomore. His blue jeans were so baggy you could stuff another whole person in there. <br> <br>"This is Michael," said Nam, her green eyes shining. She brushed a stray, baby-fine black hair from her flushed cheek. Bells around her ankles jingled every time she moved her small feet clad in tiny green elf shoes. "We've been talking most of the evening. We have so much in common!" <br> <br>Michael gave them a thin smile and shrugged, as if an introduction to the minions was a necessary evil. He squeezed Nam's shoulders, drawing her back slightly from the two girls. The bells whispered. <br> <br>"He's from New York City," said Nam. "He moved here in late summer. He's living with his aunt." Jingle. Jingle. <br> <br>"You some kind of Witch?" he asked, his expression bordering on a sneer, his eyes boring into Bethany's. Not waiting for an answer, he leaned over and whispered something in Nam's ear. Her flush deepene...</p><h2>Fitcher&#39;s Bird</h2><p>A famous American fine arts photographer creates strange images to match her retelling of a tale from the Brothers Grimm, which features a wicked wizard named Fitcher who, disguised as a beggar, steals beautiful girls.</p><p>Inventive, provocative tableaux have made Sherman a star among color photographers, but unless the elementary-school set shares a pronounced taste for the decadent, the artist's considerable talents are misdirected here. An adaptation of a tale by the Brothers Grimm, the story has all the gore of its close cousin Bluebeard: a wicked wizard ensnares hapless maidens, subjects them to an impossible test of obedience and then punishes them with a Jeffrey Dahmer-style death. This version adds a number of gothic flourishes: a skull bedecked as the head of a bride, a bride who applies first honey and then feathers to her skin, and the immolation of the wizard in a burning building. Sherman's lighting is characteristically arresting, her colors superbly saturated and her compositions frequently powerful--children, even so, are unlikely to consider her technical virtuosity when presented with her images. The heads of two dismembered dolls commune with each other, surrounded by hands and a foot; the wizard faces the fatal fire, the bared nipple of his breast lit by flames. The successful photographs hint at perversity; the others are simply stagey.

Inspired by personal experience, as well as by the literary and philosophical culture of his time, Munch radically reconceived the given world as the product of his imagination. This book explores Munch&#39;s unique artistic achievement in all its richness and diversity, surveying his career in its entire developmental range from 1880 to 1944. The comprehensive volume features a lavish selection of color plates, an introduction by Kynaston McShine, Chief Curator at Large at The Museum of Modern Art, and essays by Patricia Berman, Reinhold Heller, Elizabeth Prelinger, and Tina Yarborough, as well as in-depth documentation of Munch&#39;s art and career. It will accompany the most extensive exhibition of Munch&#39;s art in America in three decades.</p><p></p><h2>Pa-Kua: Chinese Boxing for Fitness and Self-Defense</h2><p>Originally published in 1967, <i>Pa-Kua</i> was the West&#x2019;s first look into the esoteric Chinese martial arts.

The masterpieces created by Faberge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are almost legendary treasures of superb workmanship and originality. A. Kenneth Snowman tells the story of his recent and astonishing discovery in St Petersburg of two of the original design books from the House of Faberge. Within their pages are countless meticulous watercolour and ink drawings of virtually every item made by the company from 1909 to 1915. Each design is dated and accompanied by detailed handwritten instructions as to composition and execution. Hundreds of these invaluable and incredibly beautiful drawings are reproduced here for the first time, most in full colour, with captions describing the gems, the materials to be used, and the date of manufacture. Often the actual finished pieces are photographed next to the original drawings. Among the ingenious marvels are those commissioned for the 300th anniversary celebration of the House of Romanoff, and the famous miniature and large Imperial Easter eggs, including the one owned by Queen Elizabeth II. Gold boxes, animal and bird carvings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, rings and diadems are amongst the jewels on display. A. Kenneth Snowman was curator and wrote the catalogues for the Faberge exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1977 and the Coopor-Hewitt Museum, New York, in 1983. He has written and edited many other books, including &#34;The Master Jewelers&#34; (Thames and Hudson, 1990).</p><p>For readers acquainted only with Faberge's jewel-encrusted eggs, the graceful, dainty pendants, brooches, and diadems shown here reveal the more utilitarian aspects of the famous house's business of catering to aristocratic taste. Delicate hand-colored drawings reproduced from two recently discovered design stock books dating from 1909 to 1915--many accompanied by photos of the finished products, on loan from their owners--form the bulk of the book. By his own admission, however, Snowman ( The Master Jewelers , LJ 10/15/90; Carl Faberge : Goldsmith to the Imperial Court of Russia , LJ 10/15/79) merely repeats and expands upon his September 1987 article in Apollo magazine: Out of the 205 illustrations in the book, more than 40 first appeared in Apollo , as did much of the text. Though this is a beautifully made book, in view of the availability of the Apollo article and the narrow topic, only libraries with strong interest in Faberge or comprehensive decorative art collections need to acquire it.<br><i>- Therese D.

They hold the world, and the language used to describe it, a little off to the side, where they can turn it around and, if not figure it out, at least find something funny to say about it, which, often, is not quite enough. It's been 11 years since her last book, 15 since her last novel, but <i>A Gate at the Stairs</i> is vintage Moore: brittly witty and lurkingly dark, the portrait of a Midwest college town through the eyes of Tassie Keltjin, a student from the country whose mind has been lit up by learning but who spends nearly all this story out of class, as a nanny for a couple who have adopted a toddler. Tassie's a bit of a toddler herself (and an ideal narrator because of it), testing the world as if through her teeth, and she finds the world stranger and more deeply wounded the more she learns of it. Her investigations make <i>A Gate at the Stairs</i> sad, hilarious, and thrillingly necessary. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p></p>Lorrie Moore is the author of the story collections <i>Birds of America</i>, <i>Like Life</i>, and <i>Self-Help</i> and the novels <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> and <i>Anagrams</i>.

In this revelatory, incisive biography, his real life turns out to be even more fascinating than the fictionalized autobiographies he wove about himself. With a mixture of critical detachment and sympathy, Dearborn ( Love in the Promised Land ) explores a man of contradictions. A romantic Don Juan, Miller (1891-1980) was also a misogynist who married five times. A pacifist anarchist, he advocated violence and espoused a Nietzschean apocalyptic politics in the 1930s. Until World War II he harbored a strong anti-Semitic streak, although the great obsessional love of his life, second wife June Manfield (nee Juliet Edith Smerth) was Jewish. In Paris, penniless but rejuvenated at age 39, Miller learned how to write by making his own suffering and rebirth the subject of his art. The theme of his best books is not sex, Dearborn suggestively argues, but personal and artistic survival.

It is a story of recovery, of land and food, of people, and of the power of farming and nourishing others as a way to heal our world and ourselves.</p> <p>During the past seven years, Sole Food Street Farms&#x2015;now North America&#x2019;s largest urban farm project&#x2015;has transformed acres of vacant and contaminated urban land into street farms that grow artisan-quality fruits and vegetables. By providing jobs, agricultural training, and inclusion in a community of farmers and food lovers, the Sole Food project has empowered dozens of individuals with limited resources who are managing addiction and chronic mental health problems.</p> <p>Sole Food&#x2019;s mission is to encourage small farms in every urban neighborhood so that good food can be accessible to all, and to do so in a manner that allows everyone to participate in the process. In <em>Street Farm,</em> author-photographer-farmer Michael Ableman chronicles the challenges, growth, and success of this groundbreaking project and presents compelling portraits of the neighborhood residents-turned-farmers whose lives have been touched by it. Throughout, he also weaves his philosophy and insights about food and farming, as well as the fundamentals that are the underpinnings of success for both rural farms and urban farms. <em>Street Farm</em> will inspire individuals and communities everywhere by providing a clear vision for combining innovative farming methods with concrete social goals, all of which aim to create healthier and more resilient communities.</p></p><p><p>Michael Ableman, the cofounder and director of Sole Food Street Farms, is one of the early visionaries of the urban agriculture movement. He has created high-profile urban farms in Watts, California; Goleta, California; and Vancouver, British Columbia. Ableman has also worked on and advised dozens of similar projects throughout North America and the Caribbean, and he is the founder of the nonprofit Center for Urban Agriculture. He is the subject of the award-winning PBS film <em>Beyond Organic</em> narrated by Meryl Streep. His previous books include <em>From the Good Earth</em>, <em>On Good Land</em>, and <em>Fields of Plenty</em>. Ableman lives and farms at the 120-acre Foxglove Farm on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia.</p><p>&#x201c;Most of the world&#x2019;s people live in cities, and&nbsp;<em>Street Farm</em>&nbsp;is a story of how to bring cities back to life, literally and emotionally. The cold, forbidding landscapes of urban life bring our hearts to a standstill. When streets, medians, abandoned land, parks, and byways are transformed by soil, bugs, microbes, pollinators, and seeds, lives bloom. Connectedness flourishes, and people become denizens once again.</p> <p>&#x201c;Local food is not a mere talisman or gesture. We localize food webs near our homes for identity, nourishment, and taste. Taste is a sense, but it is also a common sense. Local food not only addresses quality of life, economy, and food security, it changes our hearts. Michael Ableman has a finely honed sensibility. Read how he gardens society, grows well-being, weeds out despair, and sows hope in this wonderfully written testament to life.&#x201d;<strong>--Paul Hawken, author of&nbsp;<em>Blessed Unrest</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Whenever Michael Ableman sees a barrier, he runs over and kicks it in. Lucky for us, this strikingly focused anarchist writes about it too, sharing the deeply moving story of reclaiming land and building real community in the most unlikely places, from the ground up. Read this book and be amazed.&#x201d;<strong>--Dan Barber, chef/co-owner, Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns; author of <em>The Third Plate</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I have known Michael Ableman for over twenty years. He is one of the pioneers of small-scale urban farming, growing quality food for urban communities. He has worked through the challenges inherent to urban farming and is a premier trainer in the industry. Michael has been and is an inspiration to myself and many urban agriculture leaders around the country and the world.&#x201d;<strong>--Will Allen, founder and CEO, Growing Power</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Michael Ableman is an innovator extraordinaire whose projects have a track record of benchmarking new models of best practice. He is one of the handful of inspiring visionaries on the planet who are redefining our future food systems.&#x201d;<strong>--Patrick Holden, founding director, Sustainable Food Trust</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In this inspiring book, Michael Ableman documents that generating paradise by growing vegetables amidst the urban jungle also rehabilitates lost souls, builds community, and creates genuine economic value. <em>Street Farm</em> is a great antidote to pessimism, illustrating how even seemingly broken people can contribute to themselves, to society, and to our shared ecology.&#x201d;<strong>--Gabor Mat�, MD, author of&nbsp;<em>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Street Farm </em>tells it like it is on a gritty urban farm, introducing us to rough but real people who learn to live again through growing food and nurturing the soil. Michael Ableman shows us that we can amend distressed soils and distressed communities alike.&#x201d;<strong>--Novella Carpenter, author of <em>Farm City</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Michael Ableman recognises that urban growing is not just about producing lovely, healthy, local food. It&#x2019;s about creating meaningful work that pays a decent living and showing that the cities where most of us now live can play a vital role in building a better, more resilient food system. In <em>Street Farm</em>, Ableman writes about many of the issues that we also grapple with as we strive to build a better food system in London. Sole Food Street Farms is an uplifting demonstration of how communities really can change the world: inspiration for all those who feel they might be too small or powerless to make a difference.&#x201d;<strong>--Julie Brown, director, Growing Communities</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Michael Ableman examines the heart and soul of urban agriculture through the eyes, hands, and hearts of people in need of a place of civility and serenity. The passion and humility of the farmers who work at Sole Food Street Farms in Vancouver shines through. They are neighborhood folks, many with transgressions of addictions, who find solace in farming.</p> <p>Ableman strongly believes that farming must be grounded in an economy in which food has value and so do the people who grow it. From<em> Street Farm,</em> we learn that urban agriculture indeed takes a village of planners, politicians, investors, and believers to envision such an economy, with urban agriculture as the new economic engine providing jobs, feeding families, and building communities.&#x201d;<strong>--Karen Washington, urban farm activist; co-founder of Black Urban Growers</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This is the most inspiring book I have read in years. I found myself trembling at the monumental challenges that Michael Ableman and his colleagues faced and overcame in creating a set of urban farms in some of the most downtrodden neighborhoods on the continent. This is a story of hope, disappointment, and hope returning, detailing the mistakes and setbacks as well as the victories and benefits of creating a large-scale food-growing program in a big city.

In an instant they can bring us down or lift us up. If we don't attend to the mind, the source of all our thoughts and emotions, it can seem like a runaway train. Yet when guided by wisdom, our mind can lead us to awakening. How do we utilize this resource? <br><br>The Buddha asked big questions concerning the causes and conditions of happiness and suffering and how we can shape our mind and attitude to support our well-being. According to the Buddhist teachings, when our natural intelligence is sparked by contemplation and meditation, we discover insights into what true happiness means&#x2014;and how to achieve it. The distilled wisdom of the Buddhist tradition leads us to clarity of mind, and step by step, the light of our natural intelligence comes through. <br><br>With the humor and insight he is known for, Dzigar Kongtr�l engages us in a playful, and challenging, investigation of disturbing emotions, our relationships with others, the trap of self-centeredness, and the practicalities of working with a Buddhist teacher. Most important, he shows us the subtlest use of our own natural intelligence&#x2014;its ability to recognize the nature of reality itself.</p><p>Dzigar Kongtr�l grew up in a monastic environment and received extensive training in all aspects of Buddhist doctrine. In 1989, he moved to the United States with his family and in 1990, he began a five-year tenure as a professor of Buddhist philosophy at Naropa University. He also founded Mangala Shri Bhuti, his own teaching organization, during this period. He has established a mountain retreat center, Longchen Jigme Samten Ling, in southern Colorado. When not guiding students in long-term retreats and not in retreat himself, Rinpoche travels widely throughout the world teaching and furthering his own education.&#x201c;This slender book has wisdom for practitioners of all levels. . . . There is a comforting bravery in [Kongtr�l's] thinking that clarifies the differences between &#x2018;trying to arrange the world according to our preferences&#x2019; and &#x2018;delighting in the way our experience naturally unfolds.&#x2019; This is a suitably calm and graceful pathway illuminated by a Buddhist master.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Light Comes Through</i> shimmers with frank advice on becoming more intelligent about our emotions. Dzigar Kongtr�l offers a practical path to clarity and peace.&#x201d;&#x2014;Daniel Goleman, author of <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> <br><br>"This is a wonderful fresh look at the amazing potential of our human mind.

It is a wonderful guidebook for living a very different kind of life."&#x2014;Sharon Salzberg, author of <i>Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness </i> <br><br>&#x201c;Kongtrul writes with clarity and humor, as a teacher who wishes to communicate rather than a guru who wants to confound with the difficulty of his wisdom. The brilliance of his approach lies in the way he makes key ideas seem familiar.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Sun Sentinel</i></p><h2>Jasper Johns</h2><p>Pairing the talents of a leading American artist and the author of Jurassic Park, a collection of intellectual works featuring the artist&#39;s use of puns, optical illusion, and embedded images is accompanied by analytical text.</p><p>Johns can easily lay claim to the title of greatest living American artist, and polymath novelist/doctor Crichton here provides an indispensable overview of his career. Crichton has substantially expanded and revised his 1977 monograph on Johns to cover his latest work. Drawing on interviews with the often laconic artist as well as commentary from art historians, dealers, and friends, Crichton sketches Johns's creative processes and the development of his style. This accessible portrait of the artist's work is both insightful and enlightening, furnishing context for Johns's place in contemporary art. The extensive color and duotone photographs provide a nearly complete summation of Johns's career from the early 1950s through the present.

In the early years of the century he became the leader of a group of avant-garde artists called the Fauves ("wild beasts"), known for their use of brilliant, aggressive colors. His career spanned more than five decades and during that time he developed many other styles, from austere variations on Cubism to sensual interiors and figure paintings. Throughout his life, Matisse remained preoccupied by the subject of the female model; during the many years he spent on the Mediterranean coast he painted innumerable fantasies of women in exotic costumes. Late in life, in ill health and no longer able to sustain the exertion of painting, Matisse invented the technique of making pictures from pieces of colored paper cut out with scissors. He achieved in old age a final burst of creativity in his mural and stained glass designs for a chapel at Vence in the south of France, one of the most acclaimed ensembles of church decoration of the twentieth century.<br>This book reproduces in color more than sixty of Matisse's most remarkable paintings from all periods of his life, among them portraits, still lifes, and figures, as well as several of his paper cutouts and his designs for the chapel at Vence.</p><p>Let this handsome volume introduce you to the great French painter Henri Matisse through a brief but informative biography and more than 80 full-color reproductions.

Smoking has been banned in the UK's public places for years but something seemed to be hovering around these folk, thickening the air, turning the scene around me into an out-of-focus photograph taken on a cheap camera.I knew instinctively he wasn't there.No need to look at my watch to know I was sixteen minutes late. I'd timed it to the second. Too late would look rude, or as if I were trying to make a point; too close to the agreed time would seem eager. Calm and professional, that's what I was going to be. A little distant. Being a bit late was part of that. Except now he was the one who was late.At the bar, I ordered my usual drink-for-difficult-occasions and stretched up on to a vacant bar stool. Sipping the colourless liquid, I could see my reflection in the mirrors behind the bar. I'd come straight from work. Somehow, I'd resisted the temptation to leave early and spend the better part of two hours showering, blow-drying my hair, putting on make-up and choosing clothes. I'd been determined not to look nice for Mark Joesbury.I fished my laptop out of my bag and put it down on the bar -not actually planning to work, just to make it look that way - and opened a presentation on the UK's laws on pornography that I was due to give the following week to a group of new recruits at Hendon. I opened a slide at random - the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act. The recruits would be surprised to learn, because most people were, that possession of all non-child pornography was perfectly legal in the UK until the 2008 Act outlawed extreme pornographic images. Naturally, they'd want to know what qualified as extreme. Hence the main content of the slide I was looking at.<b>An extreme pornographic image depicts a sexual act that:</b>� <b>threatens, or appears to threaten, a person's life.</b>� <b>results in serous injury to sexual organs.</b>� <b>involves a human corpse.</b>� <b>involves an animal</b>I changed a spelling mistake in the second bullet point and added a full stop to the fourth.Joesbury hadn't arrived. Not that I'd looked round. I would know the minute he walked through the door.Twenty-four hours earlier I'd had a five-minute briefing with my DI at Southwark Police Station. SCD10, still colloquially known by everyone as SO10, the special crimes directorate of the Metropolitan Police that deals with covert operations, had requested my help with a case. Not just any young female detective constable but me specifically, and the lead officer on the case, DI Mark Joesbury, would meet me the following evening. 'What case?' I'd asked. DI Joesbury would fill me in, I was told. My DI had been tight-lipped and grumpy, probably on account of having his staff filched without being told why.I checked my watch again. He was twenty-three minutes late, my drink was disappearing too quickly and at half past I was going home.I couldn't even remember what he looked like, I realized. Oh, I had a vague idea of height, build and colouring, and I remembered those turquoise eyes, but I couldn't conjure up a picture of his face. Which was odd, really, given that he was never out of my head for a second.'Lacey Flint, as I live and breathe,' said a voice directly behind me.I took a deep breath and turned round slowly, to see Mark Joesbury, maybe just a fraction over six feet tall, strongly built, suntanned skin even in January, bright turquoise eyes. Wearing a thick, untidy, ginger wig.'I'm undercover,' he said. And then he winked at me.DEAD SCARED. Copyright � 2012 by S. J. Bolton. All rights reserved.

R. R. ( Author ) ] { Hardcover } 2014</p><p>HMH hardcover 2014 <br> previous ISBN 978-0-54444278-8 <br> 9780544442788 9780544442788The translation of <i>Beowulf</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien was an early work, very distinctive in its mode, completed in 1926: he returned to it later to make hasty corrections, but seems never to have considered its publication. This edition is twofold, for there exists an illuminating<p></p>commentary on the text of the poem by the translator himself, in the written form of a series of lectures given at Oxford in the 1930s; and from these lectures a substantial selection has been made, to form also a commentary on the translation in this book. <p></p><p></p>From his creative attention to detail in these lectures there arises a sense of the immediacy and clarity of his vision. It is as if he entered into the imagined past: standing beside Beowulf and his men shaking out their mail shirts as they beached their ship on the coast of Denmark,<p></p>listening to the rising anger of Beowulf at the taunting of Unferth, or looking up in amazement at Grendel&#x2019;s terrible hand set under the roof of Heorot.<p></p><p></p>But the commentary in this book includes also much from those lectures in which, while always anchored in the text, he expressed his wider perceptions. He looks closely at the dragon that would slay Beowulf &#x2018;snuffling in baffled rage and injured greed when he discovers the theft of the cup&#x2019;; but he rebuts the notion that this is &#x2018;a mere treasure story&#x2019;, &#x2018;just another dragon tale&#x2019;. He turns to the lines that tell of the burying of the golden things long ago, and observes that it is &#x2018;the feeling for the treasure itself, this sad history&#x2019; that raises it to another level. &#x2018;The whole thing is sombre, tragic, sinister, curiously real. The "treasure" is not just some lucky wealth that will enable the finder to have a good time, or marry the princess. It is laden with history, leading back into the dark heathen ages beyond the memory of song, but not beyond the reach of imagination.&#x2019;<p></p><p></p><i>Sellic Spell</i>, a &#x2018;marvellous tale&#x2019;, is a story written by Tolkien suggesting what might have been the form and style of an Old English folk tale of Beowulf, in which there was no association with the &#x2018;historical legends&#x2019; of the Northern kingdoms.</p><h2>Tomorrow Is a River</h2><p>Caroline Quimby, deserted by her husband, Reverend Quimby, is befriended by Kemink Tartone, a Menominee Indian woman and together they struggle to survive a bitter Wisconsin winter</p><p></p><h2>To Dream of the Dead (Merrily Watkins Mysteries)</h2><p><p>The village of Ledwardine has never been flooded in living memory, but as the river continues to rise with December rains, within days it will be an island. Electricity has been cut and the church is serving as a temporary mortuary for two people who drowned. Only one man feels safe: an aggressively atheist author who has been moved for his own safety into a secluded house just outside the village. Meanwhile, archaeologists assisted by Merrily Watkins&#x2019;s teenage daughter, Jane are at work unearthing an ancient row of standing stones&nbsp;that some people would prefer stay buried. The atheist&#x2019;s temporary home is close to the site, and his young wife is becoming conspicuously agitated. Is it the fear of discovery? With the flood water washing up Church Lane towards the vicarage and the shop running out of cigarettes, it looks to be a cold and complex Christmas for Merrily Watkins.</p></p><p>Phil Rickman is the author of&nbsp;the Merrily Watkins Mystery series.Emma Powell is the ideal narrator for Rickman&#39;s unique series featuring parish priest Merrily Watkins. Powell delivers an authentic accent for the residents of rural Hereford, England, both the educated and those who remain close to the region&#39;s superstitions. The always-cool-and-composed Merrily and her passionate daughter, Jane, are fascinating counterpoints to the timely issues that make up these layered mysteries. In this one, as Christmas approaches and a flood threatens, Merrily must weigh right and wrong, and ancient and modern beliefs as she decides how to assist her beloved church and congregation. Powell also skillfully depicts the heavy weather and strongly flowing river that are so much a part of the story&#39;s atmosphere.

For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the <i>Books of Blood</i> is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes: <p> </p> I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. <p> Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. </p> <p> These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><p>Born in Liverpool in 1952, Clive Barker has written and produced a number of Grand Guignol plays, including <b>The History of the Devil</b> and <b>Frankenstein in Love</b>.

Yet it's been a decade since she disappeared under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind her small daughter, husband, and the animals to which she devoted her life. All signs point to abandonment. . .or worse. Still Jenna--now 13 years old and truly orphaned by a father maddened by grief--steadfastly refuses to believe in her mother's desertion. So she decides to approach the 2 people who might still be able to help her find Alice: a disgraced psychic named Serenity Jones, and Virgil Stanhope, the cynical detective who first investigated her mother's disappearance and the strange, possibly linked death of 1 of her mother's co-workers. Together these 3 lonely souls will discover truths destined to forever change their lives.

The connection isn't as odd as it might sound at first, and Picoult has written another page-turning novel, even as it focuses on motherhood, loss, and grief. Teenager Jenna Metcalf was just three years old when her mother disappeared from an elephant sanctuary. Ten years later, she takes up the search for her mother, Alice, by studying Alice&#x2019;s decade-old journals on grieving elephants. The research itself is fascinating, the hints about Alice&#x2019;s disappearance are compelling; but Jenna cannot find her mother on her own. By enlisting the help of a formerly famous&#x2014;now infamous&#x2014;psychic, as well as a down-and-out private detective whose career went south during the botched investigation of Alice's disappearance, Jenna forms a sort of new family to help her in her quest. As the facts begin to come together&#x2014;described in alternating chapters by Jenna, the psychic, the private detective, and Alice&#x2019;s journals&#x2014;it all heads toward a thrilling conclusion.

Before that war, not a single Hudson River bridge or tunnel had been built. It wasn't until Americans looked to the land in the fight for independence that the importance of crossing the river efficiently became a subject of serious interest, especially militarily. Later, the needs of a new transportation system became critical--when steam railroads first rolled along there was no practical way to get them across the water without bridges.<br><br><i>Crossing the Hudson</i> continues this story soon after the end of the war, in 1805, when the first bridge was completed. Donald E. Wolf simultaneously tracks the founding of the towns and villages along the water's edge and the development of technologies such as steam and internal combustion that demanded new ways to cross the river. As a result, innovative engineering was created to provide for these resources.<br><br>From hybrid, timber arch, and truss bridges on stone piers to long-span suspension and cantilevered bridges, railroad tunnels, and improvements in iron and steel technology, the construction feats that cross the Hudson represent technical elegance and physical beauty. <i>Crossing the Hudson</i> reveals their often multileveled stories--a history of where, why, when, and how these structures were built; the social, political, and commercial forces that influenced decisions to erect them; the personalities of the planners and builders; the unique connection between a builder and his bridge; and the design and construction techniques that turned mythical goals into structures of utility and beauty.</p><p>&#34;Crossing the Hudson&#34; reveals the often multileveled stories of the river&#39;s bridges and tunnels, from timber arch and truss bridges on stone piers to long-span suspension and cantilevered bridges, railroad tunnels, and improvements in iron and steel technology, providing a history of where, why, when, and how these structures were built; the social, political, and commercial forces that influenced decisions to erect them; the personalities of the planners and builders; the unique connection between builder and bridge; and the design and construction techniques that turned mythical goals into structures of utility and beauty.DONALD E.

They became medical celebrities: every week, eager crowds arrived at the hospital to observe their symptoms; they were photographed, sculpted, painted, and transformed into characters in novels. The remarkable story of their lives as patients in the clinic is a strange amalgam of intimate details and public exposure, science and religion, medicine and the occult, hypnotism, love, and theater.<br><br> But who were Blanche, Augustine, and Genevieve? What role did they play in their own peculiar form of stardom? And what exactly were they suffering from? Hysteria&#x2015;with its dramatic seizures, hallucinations, and reenactments of past traumas&#x2015;may be an illness of the past, but the notions of femininity that lie behind it offer insights into disorders of the present. 40 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><b>Asti Hustvedt</b> received her PhD in French literature from New York University. She has worked as an editor and translator, and lives in New York City with her family.Before she entered Salp�tri�re Hospital in 1877, Blanche Wittmann was just another damaged child from a poor neighborhood of Paris. Raped by an employer, angry and seizure-prone, the 17-year-old girl almost inevitably became a charity patient of the hospital���s mental wards. Once there, however, she came to the attention of one of France���s most famous scientists, the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. Acclaimed for his work in diseases of the nervous system (he was the first physician to recognize that ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was a disease of motor neurons), Charcot had developed a keen interest in the kind of neurotic fits exhibited by the teenage Blanche. Under his care and&#x2014;critics would claim&#x2014;his manipulation, she became not just a patient but a star performer known as �ǣthe queen of hysterics.�ǥ As Hustvedt details in this compassionate history, the doctor not only studied patients like Blanche, he turned them into public exhibits. Charcot and his colleagues, experimenting with treatment by hypnosis, often held theatrical demonstrations of their power over these troubled women: �ǣOnce hypnotized, Blanche became a smoothly running woman-machine....�ǥ These performances have led earlier writers to obsess over the circus-tent nature of the proceedings and the male arrogance of the research. And Hustvedt does explore those issues as well as Charcot���s eventual fall from professional grace. But her real fascination is in turning these so-called machines into real women, and she tells her story by deliberately focusing on three very dissimilar patients: the celebrated and obedient Blanche; a pretty and incurably willful Augustine; and a religion-crazed, demon-obsessed teenager called Genevi�ve. They are also completely alike in being poor, powerless, desperate. Their lives provide a near shocking contrast to the privileged existence of Charcot, married into wealth, residing in an ornate mansion on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. That imbalance is so strong (and wrong) that even today it overshadows his research into the elusive nature of neurotic behaviors. Hustvedt comes from a literary family; her sister is novelist and essayist Siri Hustvedt, her brother-in-law Paul Auster. And she has worked as both an editor and translator. But this is her first time out as a book author, and it���s not surprising to find signs of inexperience in the work. She struggles with doing justice to the complex nature of Charcot���s work; she visibly gropes for a meaningful resolution to her tale. Still, she does a lovely, sympathetic job of illuminating the lost lives of the famous hysterics, reminding us that the story of science, far from being purely clinical, is ever the most human of stories. 40 illus.

It is with no disrespect to the above Associations or to those Instructors that I have used their knowledge and formats and words to make these manuals. I hope that these manuals aid you in understanding not only the &#34;How&#34; of Kenpo but also the &#34;Whys&#34; of Kenpo. Remember; The man who knows &#34;How&#34; will always be a student, but the man who knows &#34;Why&#34; will continue to be the Instructor. Ed Parker; &#34;The Zen of Kenpo&#34; Welcome to the second Manual of the Lacerte&#39;s Kenpo Karate Academy series of the Instructor&#39;s Master Text Manuals. As stated in all of these Manuals, It is with no disrespect to any Kenpo Association, to Mr. Ed Parker. Or to any of the many First Generation Black Belt that I have trained under and have taken Notes from, nor to my Current Instructor Mr. Skip Hancock. in to which I have utilized their formats, ways of Teaching, or their wisdom, to put together these Manuals. By utilizing all these people&#39;s knowledge under one book aided me in creating a complete and knowledgeable Manual that my students and Instructors may use to understand what should be taught within a structured class, that will be accepted in any Kenpo Studio that teaches Ed Parker&#39;s American Kenpo Karate.</p><p>Greetings my name is Professor Leo R. Lacerte and I am the Vice President of the Ohana Kenpo Karate Association, and a 6th Degree Black Belt in Ed Parkers&#39; American Kenpo Karate. Inside these books you will find requirements from the ranks of Yellow Belt through 4th Degree Black Belt. I began this project back around 1990 just after the passing of our beloved Senior Grand Master Edmund K. Parker. I made a call to Mrs. Leileni Parker (Ed Parkers&#39; wife and then President of the IKKA) to see if they would be continuing their Manuals of Kenpo. At that time, they had only had published the Green Belt Manual (later they Published the 3rd and 2nd Degree Brown Belt Manuals), but she informed me that would be it, because I already had earlier purchased 3 copies of the Accumulative Journal, as well as my personal training, I knew there was much more to offer. I expressed my desire to have more knowledge through the Manuals, and she said to me (Phone Conversation), &#34;We were going to do this but many instructors could not understand them, therefore we&#39;re not&#34; Well I felt slighted; I really enjoyed these Manuals because they reflected upon what I was teaching. Well it was then I began to put down all information on what I had to offer, this was through Research of many different Manuals, Ed Parkers&#39; many Books and Magazine articles, and the many Notes that I had taken in Seminars and Work-shops throughout the United States as well as from my Instructors. In the following 7 Books you will see the results, All Basics, Sayings, Terminology, Sets, Forms, Self Defense Techniques, and Freestyle Techniques are explained, along with Principles and Concepts. Following is a list of these books; 1. Ed Parkers&#39; Basic Fundamentals - Yellow Belt - 1st Degree Black Belt Basics. 2. EPAK Beginners Book 1 - Yellow and Orange Belt Manual. 3.

Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.You can tell theres been an additional hand at work in this latest Men at War installment from W.E.B. Griffin. The writing isnt as deft as that of the master. But Paul Hecht prevails as he sails through the plot. In this segment, OSS Operative Dick Canidy must use disinformation to convince the Nazis that the European invasion will not start at the French coast. Hechts German, French, and Cockney accents are near perfect as the authors shift from Axis to Allied headquarters. Notably missing, however, are the usual entertaining escapades of Canidy and a coterie of characters. Nonetheless, thanks to Hecht, Canidys banter will keep listeners entertained.

It examines how the Spanish Civil War developed on the battlefield through the prism of eight campaigns between 1937-1939 and shows how many accounts of military operations during this conflict are based upon half-truths and propaganda.<br><br>The book is based upon nearly 60 years of extensive research into the Spanish Civil War, augmented by information from specialized German, Italian and Russian works. The Italian campaign against the Basques on the Northern Front in 1937 was one of the most spectacular Nationalist successes of the Civil War, with 60,000 prisoners taken. This is also the first book to quote secret data about Italian air operations intercepted by the British. The figures intercepted by the British show the Italians flew 1,215 sorties and dropped 231 tons of bombs during the campaign, whilst also suffering the heaviest losses.<br><br>It also demonstrates how the Nationalists won not simply by benefitting from a cornucopia of modern arms from the Fascist powers but by using its limited resources to maximum effect. Spain in Arms reveals the Nationalist battlefield superiority in terms of training and overall command, and the Republic's corresponding weaknesses in the same fields. The Republican Brunete and Belchite offensives of 1937 are described in detail, from the weapons they carried and the tactics they employed to the dynamic Nationalist response and reaction of the generals. This book also explores how the extent of foreign intervention on both sides has been greatly exaggerated throughout history and provides the first accurate information on this military intervention, using British and French archives to produce a radically different but more accurate account of the battles and the factors and men who shaped them.<br><br>Hooton finally gives the historical context and operational implications of the battlefield events to provide a link between the First and Second World Wars.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Prologue<br>Chapter 1: Madrid Front February-March 1937<br>Chapter 2: The New Armies and weapons<br>Chapter 3: Northern Front April-October 1937<br>Chapter 4: Republican offensives July-October 1937<br>Chapter 5: The Nationalist Advance November 1937-October 1938<br>Chapter 6: The Last Battles; July 1938-February 1939</p><p>E. R. Hooton is a retired defence journalist and a member of the British Commission for Military History as well as being a member of the Royal United Services Institute. He has written numerous articles on military history and three highly regarded books on the history of the Luftwaffe &#x2013; &#x2018;The Luftwaffe &#x2013; A Study in Air Power 1933-1945&#x2019; (2010) &#x2018;Phoenix Triumphant: The Rise and Rise of the Luftwaffe&#x2019; (1992) and &#x2018;Eagle in Flames: The Fall of the Luftwaffe&#x2019; (1997). He has also written a detailed history of air operations over the Western Front.&#x201c;Hooton does write in surprisingly fast-moving prose (&#x201c;Glory-hunting Berti asked Franco to rein in Aranda and give the Italians the privilege of reaching the sea first, but received very short shrift&#x201d;). This meticulous study will be catnip for specialists studying the war&#x2014;and only them.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"This book cuts all of the fat and gristle away to give you only the juicy meat of the military history."

No story is too painful to tell&#x2015;like how much she enjoyed fat camp. Nor too off-limits&#x2015;like her critique of R. Crumb. Nor too personal&#x2015;like her stories of growing up Jewish in Florida. Using her sweet but biting wit, Davis effortlessly carves out a wholly original and refreshing niche in two well-worn territories: autobio comics and the Jewish identity. </p><p>Davis draws strips from her daily diary, centering on her youth, mother, relationships with men, and eventually her longtime boyfriend. Her intimacy, self-deprecation, and candor have deservedly earned her many accolades and awards. Her deft comedic touch, lush color, and immediacy will set Davis apart not only as one of the premier cartoonists, but as one of the leading humorists for her generation, too.</p></p><p><p><b>Vanessa Davis</b> was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, and lives in Santa Rosa, California. She is the author of <i>Spaniel Rage</i>. Her comics have appeared in <i>Vice</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Tablet</i>.</p>These beautifully rendered watercolor and pencil collages capture confessional moments from bat mitzvah to the author taking her boyfriend home to West Palm Beach, Fla., to visit her mother. While treading in the autobiographical path of many cartoonists before her, Davis's sweet and well-observed sketch-diary entries and more structured pieces for such magazines as the Tablet deal with growing up as a Jewish woman. Some time is given to fashion and dating, but the focus is mostly on the daily humor of surviving a boring day job and squabbling family. What sets Davis apart, as least as she portrays herself, is her general sanity and good humor. The problems are more Family Circus than Fun Home: a sisterly blowup comes down to the disposition of a doughnut, and a relationship problem involves several half-eaten packages of cheese. An early strip deals with a trip to a fat farm, but even that ends with remarkably little self-loathing. What this collection does show is Davis's evolution from sometimes awkward swirls of penciled diary pages to constantly inventive and very accomplished painted art. It's hard not to find something to identify with or smile at in these pages. (Oct.) (c) <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What started out as a day trip spirals into a nightmare when they reach the ruins . . . and discover the terrifying presence that lurks there.</p><p>In 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with <i>A Simple Plan</i>, his stunning debut thriller about what happens when three men find a wrecked plane and bag stuffed with over 4 million dollars--a book that Stephen King called "Simply the best suspense novel of the year!" Now, thirteen years after writing a novel that turned into a pretty great movie featuring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton, Smith is back, with <i>The Ruins</i>, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle. Who better to tell readers if Smith has done it again than the undisputed King of Horror (and champion of Smith's first book)? We asked Stephen King to read <i>The Ruins</i> and give us his take. Check out his review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Stephen King</strong><br><br><b>Stephen King is the author of too many bestselling books to name here, but some of our favorites include: <i>Cell</i>, <i>The Stand</i>, <i>On Writing</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, and the entire Dark Tower series. King also received the National Book Foundation 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, has had many movies and television miniseries adapted from his novels, short stories, and screenplays, and is a regular columnist for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. Keep your eyes peeled for <i>Lisey's Story</i> (October 2006), a new television series on TNT based on <i>Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes </i> (July 2007), and a graphic novel series based on the Dark Tower books coming from Marvel (2007). </b><br><br> When I heard that Scott Smith was publishing a new novel this summer, I felt the way I did when my kids came in an hour or two late from their weekend dates: a combination of welcoming relief (thank God you're back) mingled with exasperation and anger (where the hell have you been?). Well, it's only a book, you say, and maybe that's true, but Scott Smith is a singularly gifted writer, and it seems to me that the twelve years between his debut--the cult smash <i>A Simple Plan</i>--and his return this summer with <i>The Ruins</i> is cause for exasperation, if not outright anger. Certainly Smith, who has been invisible save for his Academy Award-nominated screenplay for the film version of <i>A Simple Plan</i>, will have some 'splainin to do about how he spent his summer vacation. Make that his last twelve summer vacations.<p> But enough. The new book is here, and the question devotees of <i>A Simple Plan</i> will want answered is whether or not this book generates anything like <i>Plan</i>'s harrowing suspense. The answer is yes. <i>The Ruins</i> is going to be America's literary shock-show this summer, doing for vacations in Mexico what Jaws did for beach weekends on Long Island. Is it as successful and fulfilling as a novel? The answer is not quite, but I can live with that, because it's riskier. There will be reviews of this book by critics who have little liking or understanding for popular fiction who'll dismiss it as nothing but a short story that has been bloated to novel length (I'm thinking of Michiko Kakutani, for instance, who microwaved Smith's first book). These critics, who steadfastly grant pop fiction no virtue but raw plot, will miss the dazzle of Smith's technique; <i>The Ruins</i> is the equivalent of a triple axel that just misses perfection because something's wrong with the final spin.</p><p> It's hard to say much about the book without giving away everything, because the thing is as simple and deadly as a leg-hold trap concealed in a drift of leaves...or, in this case, a mass of vines. You've got four young American tourists--Eric, Jeff, Amy, and Stacy--in Cancun. They make friends with a German named Mathias whose brother has gone off into the jungle with some archeologists. These five, plus a cheerful Greek with no English (but a plentiful supply of tequila), head up a jungle trail to find Mathias's brother...the archaeologists...and the ruins.</p><p> Well, two out of three ain't bad, according to the old saying, and in this case; what's waiting in the jungle isn't just bad, it's horrible. Most of <i>The Ruins</i>'s 300-plus pages is one long, screaming close-up of that horror. There's no let-up, not so much as a chapter-break where you can catch your breath. I felt that <i>The Ruins</i> did draw on a trifle, but I found Scott Smith's refusal to look away heroic, just as I did in A Simple Plan. It's the trappings of horror and suspense that will make the book a best seller, but its claim to literature lies in its unflinching naturalism. It's no <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, but at its suffocating, terrifying, claustrophobic best, it made me think of Frank Norris. Not a bad comparison, at that.</p><p> One only hopes Mr. Smith won't stay away so long next time.<i>--Stephen King</i> </p><br>What happens when one simple, innocent decision becomes a catastrophic mistake� <p>Craving an adventure on their Mexican holiday before they return home, a group of four friends impulsively set off in search of one of their own who has travelled to the interior to investigate an archaeological dig in the Mayan ruins. </p> <p>After a long journey into the heart of the jungle, the group come across trail.

But rather than force the owners of the house, a German widower and his rebellious daughter, out onto the streets, Lewis insists that the two families live together. In this charged atmosphere, both parents and children will be forced to confront their true selves as enmity and grief give way to passion and betrayal, to their deepest desires, their fiercest loyalties, and the transforming power of forgiveness. <br><br> This courageous new novel from award-winning author Rhidian Brook tells an emotionally riveting story of two families, one house, and love grown from hate.</p></p><p>Rhidian Brook is an award-winning writer of fiction, television, and film.

He traced a line west from the pinhead marking their temporary headquarters, away from the bombed-out districts of Hammerbrook and St. Georg, over St. Pauli and Altona, towards the old fishing suburb of Blankenese, where the Elbe veered up and debouched into the North Sea. The map&#x2014;pulled from a pre-war German guidebook&#x2014;failed to show that these conurbations were now a phantom city comprised only of ash and rubble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bloody great palace by the river. Here.&#x201d; Wilkins&#x2019;s finger circled the crook at the end of the Elbchaussee, the road running parallel to the great river. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;ll be to your taste, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The word belonged to another world: a world of surplus and civil comfort. In the last few months, Lewis&#x2019;s tastes had narrowed to a simple checklist of immediate and basic needs: 2,500 calories a day, tobacco, warmth. &#x201c;A bloody great palace by the river&#x201d; suddenly seemed to him like the demand of a frivolous king.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had &#x201c;gone off &#x201d; again; off into that unruly parliament inside his head, a place where, more and more, he found himself in hot debate with colleagues.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there someone living in it already?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilkins wasn&#x2019;t sure how to respond. His CO was a man of excel- lent repute with an impeccable war record, but he seemed to have these quirks, a way of seeing things differently. The young captain resorted to reciting what he had read in the manual: &#x201c;These people have little moral compass, sir. They are a danger to us and to them- selves. They need to know who is in charge. They need leadership. A firm but fair hand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis nodded and waved the captain on, saving his words. The cold and the calories had taught him to ration these.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The house belongs to a family called Lubert. Loo-bear-t. Hard &#x2018;T.&#x2019; The wife died in the bombings. Her family were bigwigs in the food trade. Connections with Blohm and Voss. They also owned a series of flour mills. Herr Lubert was an architect. He&#x2019;s not been cleared yet but we think he&#x2019;s a probable white or, at worst, an acceptable shade of grey; no obvious direct Nazi connections.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bread.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had not eaten all day and had taken the short leap from &#x201c;flour mill&#x201d; to bread without thinking; the bread he pictured in his head was suddenly more present, more real, than the captain stand- ing at the map on the other side of the desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on&#x2014;the family.&#x201d; Lewis made an effort to look as if he was listening, nodding and setting his jaw at an inquisitive tilt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilkins continued: &#x201c;Lubert&#x2019;s wife died in &#x2019;43. In the firestorm. One child&#x2014;a daughter. Freda, fifteen years old. They have some staff&#x2014;a maid, a cook and a gardener. The gardener is a first-rate handyman&#x2014;ex-Wehrmacht. The family have some relatives they can move in with. We can billet the staff, or you can take them on. They&#x2019;re clean enough.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The process by which the soul-sifters of the Control Commis-sion&#x2019;s Intelligence Branch assessed cleanliness was the Fragebogen, or questionnaire: 133 questions to determine the degree of a German citizen&#x2019;s collaboration with the regime. From this, they were categorized into three colour-coded groups&#x2014;black, grey and white, with intermediate shades for clarity&#x2014;and dispatched accordingly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re expecting the requisition. It&#x2019;s just a matter of you viewing the place then turfing them out. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll be disappointed, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think they will be disappointed, Captain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Luberts? When I turf them out.&#x201d; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not allowed the luxury of disappointment, sir. They&#x2019;re Germans.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course. How silly of me.&#x201d; Lewis left it there. Any more such questions and this efficient young officer with his shiny Sam Browne and perfect puttees would have him reported to Psychiatric.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stepped from the overheated British Military Detachment Headquarters into the premature cold of a late-September day. He blew vapour and pulled on the kid gloves that Captain McLeod, the American cavalry officer, had given him in the town hall at Bremen the day the Allies had announced the division lines of the new Germany. &#x201c;Looks like you get the bum deal,&#x201d; he had said, reading the directive. &#x201c;The French get the wine, we get the view and you guys get the ruins.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had lived among the ruins for so long now he had stopped noticing them. His uniform was fitting garb for a governor in this new, quadripartite Germany&#x2014;a kind of internationalized mufti which, in the midst of post-war disorientation and re-regulation, passed without comment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The American gloves were prized but it was his Russian-front sheepskin coat that gave him the most pleasure, its provenance traceable back via the American to a Luftwaffe lieutenant who had, in turn, taken it from a captured Red Army colonel. He&#x2019;d be wearing it soon enough if this weather kept up.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a relief to get away from Wilkins. The young officer was one of the new brigade of civil servants that made up the Control Commission, Germany, a bloated force of clipboard men who saw themselves as the architects of the reconstruction. Few of these people had seen action&#x2014;or even a German&#x2014;and this allowed them to pronounce and theorize their way to decisions with confidence. Wilkins would make major before long.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis took a silver-plated cigarette case from his coat and opened it, catching the light from the sun on its clear, buffed surface. He polished it regularly. The case was the only material treasure he had with him, a parting gift from Rachael given to him at the gates of the last proper house he&#x2019;d lived in&#x2014;in Amersham, three years ago. &#x201c;Think of me when you smoke&#x201d; was her instruction, and this he had tried to do, fifty, sixty times a day for three years; a little ritual to keep the flame of love alive. He lit a cigarette and thought about that flame. With distance and time it had been easy to make it seem hotter than it was. The remembrance of their lovemaking and of his wife&#x2019;s olive-smooth, curvy flesh had sustained him through the cold and lonely months (her flesh seemingly growing smoother and curvier as the war went by). But he had grown so comfortable with this imagined, ersatz version of his wife that the imminent prospect of actually touching and smelling her unsettled him.<br> &nbsp;<br> A sleek black Mercedes 540K with a British pennant on the bon- net pulled up in front of the steps of the headquarters. The Union Jack at the wing mirror was the only thing that looked out of place. Despite its associations, Lewis liked this vehicle, its lines and the silky purr of its engine. It was appointed like an ocean-going liner, and the ultra-careful driving style of his driver&#x2014;Herr Schroeder&#x2014; added to the impression of it being like a ship. No amount of British insignia could de-Germanize this car, though. British military personnel were built for the bumbling, bulbous Austin 16, not these brute-beautiful, world-conquering machines.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis walked down the steps and gave his driver a half-salute.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder, a reedy, unshaven man wearing a black cap and cape, leapt from the driver&#x2019;s seat and walked briskly round to the rear passenger door. He bowed once in Lewis&#x2019;s direction and, with a flourish of his cape, opened the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The front seat is fine, Herr Schroeder.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder seemed agitated at Lewis&#x2019;s self-demotion. &#x201c;Nein, Herr Kommandant.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Really. Sehr gut,&#x201d; Lewis repeated. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bitte, Herr Oberst.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder clunked the rear door shut and held up a hand, still not wanting Lewis to lift a finger. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis stepped back, playing the game, but the German&#x2019;s deference depressed him: these were the motions of a defeated man clinging to patronage. Inside, Lewis handed Schroeder the scrap of paper on which Wilkins had scribbled the address of the house that was probably going to be his home for the foreseeable future. The driver squinted at it and nodded his approval of the destination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder was forced to steer a weaving course between the bomb craters that pocked the cobbled road and the rivulets of people walking in dazed, languid fashion, going nowhere in particular, carrying the remnant objects of their old lives in parcels, sacks, crates and cartons, and a heavy, almost visible, disquiet. They were like a people thrown back to the evolutionary stage of nomadic gatherers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ghost of a tremendous noise hung over the scene. Something out of this world had undone this place and left an impossible jig- saw from which to reconstruct the old picture. There was no put- ting it back together again and there would be no going back to the old picture. This was Stunde Null. The Zero Hour. These people were starting from scratch and scratching a living from nothing. Two women pushed and pulled a horse cart stacked with furniture between them, while a man carrying a briefcase walked along as though in search of the office where he once worked without even a glance at the fantastic destruction that lay all around him, as if this apocalyptic architecture were the natural state of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> A smashed city stretched as far as the eye could see, the rubble reaching as high as the first floor of any building still standing. Hard to believe that this was once a place where people read newspapers, made cakes and thought about which pictures to hang on the walls of their front parlours. The facade of a church stood on one side of the road, with only sky for stained glass and the wind for a congregation. On the other side, apartment blocks&#x2014;intact except for the fronts, which had been completely blown off, revealing the rooms and furniture within&#x2014;stood like giant doll&#x2019;s houses. In one of these rooms, oblivious to the elements and exposure to watching eyes, a woman stood lovingly brushing a young girl&#x2019;s hair in front of a dressing table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Further along the road, women and children stood around piles of rubble, scavenging for sustenance or looking to save fragments of their past. Black crosses marked the places where bodies lay waiting to be buried. And, everywhere, the strange pipe-chimneys of a subterranean city protruded from the ground, pouring black smoke into the sky.<br></p></p><h2>Every Man a Warrior Book 2: Marriage and Raising Children</h2><p>After walking with God, marriage and raising children are the most important responsibilities in a married man's life.

From 1902 to 1907, he attended Amsterdam&#x2019;s&nbsp; School of Arts and Crafts, where he became interested in architecture. His early work involved designing textiles, furniture, and interiors in a style that showed his affinity for the de Stijl art movement. Zwart was influenced by many of the modern, avant-garde movements, as well as Jan Tschichold&#x2019;s (1902&#x2013;1974) Die Neue Typographie (The New Typography, 1928). He was also one of the first modernist&nbsp; designers in Holland to apply the principles of de Stijl and constructivism to graphic design in the built environment during the 1920s. From 1921 to 1927, Zwart worked for H. P. Berlage, the most influential&nbsp; Dutch architect of the era. Hendrik Pieter (H. P.) Berlage (1856&#x2013; 1934) was the architect for the First Church of Christ Scientist complex in The Hague. This modernist complex is composed of a church, assembly hall, residence, and school with its interiors designed by Berlage, in collaboration with Zwart. One primary example of this collaboration is located above the entrance to the complex in a series of metallic gold-on-blue ceramic tiles containing bold, square, sans-serif &#x201c;fat-face&#x201d; letterforms designed by Zwart to visually integrate with the rectangular architectural form of the church. Throughout the&nbsp; auditorium, typographic inspirational quotations are located on walls and ceilings articulated in a similar graphic manner by Zwart, reinforcing a strong visual integrity to the graphic and architectural identities of the buildings.<br><br>Zwart synthesized two distinct and contradictory points of view&#x2014;the constructivist movement&#x2019;s visual playfulness and de Stijl&#x2019;s formal functionality. With the First Church of Christ Scientist, as well as with his&nbsp; entire body of work, this typotekt, as he called himself, created a unified language that has prevailed for the last eighty years and to this day strongly influences contemporary graphic designers.<br></p><h2>A Sweeper-Up After Artists: A Memoir</h2><p>A brilliant memoir by the renowned art historian offers a fascinating insider&#39;s study of the world of modern art, the evolution of various styles of art, and his relationship with Barnett Newman, William de Kooning, Mark Rothko, David Smith, and other notable artists, critics, scholars, and collectors.</p><p><b>Irving Sandler</b>'s four-volume history of postwar American art includes <i>The Triumph of American Painting, The New York School, American Art of the 1960s</i>, and <i>Art of the Postmodern Era</i>. He was the manager of The Club of the Abstract Expressionists, a cofounder of Artists' Space, and is currently the Chairman of the Artists' Advisory Committee of the Sharpe Foundation.The title of distinguished art critic Sandler's piquantly conversational memoir is from a poem by Frank O'Hara and provides a clue to Sandler's candid and humble recognition that as valuable as a critic's work is, it is secondary to the artist's. After experiencing an epiphany while looking at a painting by Franz Kline, Sandler soon became witness to and champion of New York's avant-garde art world, crucial roles he played to perfection for more than 40 years. The author of numerous seminal monographs, Sandler now recounts his unique and felicitous experiences in an irresistible mix of personal reminiscence and penetrating analysis, recalling how his quest to understand the mysterious power of certain works of art led him to visit artists' studios, conduct interviews, direct such pivotal artists' organizations as the Tanager Gallery and the Club, and write countless reviews. Sandler's profiles of Wilhelm de Kooning (his hero), Philip Guston, Alex Katz, and many others are as discerning as they are vivid, and the invaluable insider knowledge he shares brilliantly illuminates a world-changing era in the annals of creativity. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As Jacob grew up, though, he decided that these photos were obvious fakes, simple forgeries designed to stir up his youthful imagination. Or were they...?Following his grandfather&#39;s death - a scene Jacob literally couldn&#39;t believe with his own eyes - the sixteen-year-old boy embarks on a mission to disentangle fact from fiction in his grandfather&#39;s tall tales. But even his grandfather&#39;s elaborate yarns couldn&#39;t prepare Jacob for the eccentricities he will discover at Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children!</p><p>Ransom Riggs grew up in Florida, where he spent his formative years making silly movies with his friends in their various backyards, snorkeling, and complaining about the heat. He studied English at Kenyon College and film at the University of Southern California. He lives in Los Angeles. He makes films you can watch on his YouTube page: www.youtube.com/ransriggs. He enjoys traveling to exotic lands and complaining about the heat. He would like to thank you for reading this short biography.A graphic adaptation of Riggs&#x2019;s popular crossover novel might seem like a strange prospect since the original is already illustrated with the odd, antique photos that inspired Riggs&#x2019; unusual tale. But Jean (Beautiful Creatures, 2013) doesn&#x2019;t try to overshadow the pictures with her artwork, instead seamlessly blending them in. At first readers will find those photos as fake as 16-year-old Jacob does, believing them to be nothing more than false memories that helped his grandfather survive WWII. But when monsters prove to be real and kill Jacob&#x2019;s grandfather, the boy must flee to an island off the coast of Wales to find the &#x201c;peculiar&#x201d; children who sheltered his grandfather, who will help Jacob learn who he is, and who he will, in the end, have to save from the monsters. Jean&#x2019;s scratchy black-and-white line drawings perfectly detail Jacob&#x2019;s mundane life until he discovers the island&#x2019;s secrets and color comes winging in. The luminous art brings the heart of Riggs&#x2019; story to life&#x2014;albeit at the expense of some character development&#x2014;and should leave readers eager for the next installment.

Alone on the island is a school for juvenile delinquents, the Penikese Island School, where Daniel Robb lived and worked as a teacher, not far from the mainland town where he grew up. By turns harsh, desolate, and starkly beautiful, the island offers its temporary residents respire from lives filled with abuse, violence, and chaos. But as Robb discovers, peace, solitude, and a structured lifestyle can go only so far toward healing the anger and hurt he finds not only in his students but within himself - feelings left over from the broken home of his childhood. Lyrical and heartfelt, Crossing the Water is the memoir of his first eighteen months on Penikese, and a poignant meditation on the many ways that young men can become lost.<br>Ranging in age from fourteen to seventeen and numbering up to eight at a time, some of Robb's students at Penikese have been convicted of crimes including arson, assault, and armed robbery. They are tough, troubled kids who are sentenced to the school by courts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. During their time at Penikese, they live in a house together with the staff of four and share the responsibilities of living on the island - chopping wood, cooking meals, maintaining and repairing the buildings, caring for the farm animals, and doing other chores. For many of the students, it's the first time they've experienced such a combination of discipline and freedom, or the kind of trust extended to them by the staff. And despite their resistance and sometime wildness, Robb soon finds that they have the capacity not only to confound but to surprise him, both with their insight and their vulnerability. In Crossing the Water, he renders the boys' voices and his life with them - the confrontations, the rare epiphanies, the flashes of humor - with great vividness.</p><p>It's a rare pleasure when a new author shows not only notable talent, but the skill and chutzpah to go where no one else has gone before. Daniel Robb takes a subject that many have considered but few understood--juvenile delinquents--and writes about it with rare insight. For a year and a half, Robb was a teacher on Penikese Island, off Cape Cod, where teenage boys are sent by the courts and social services to put six months between themselves and their chaotic daily lives. During this time they experience safety, a routine, hard work, and the decency and constancy of adults better adjusted than the ones they've known. The place is less a school, Robb writes, than "a family, or a way of life, a rhythm, a discipline, a music, with many voices of boys competing with my own for ownership of the tale." The boys have varied r�sum�s: Mose shot a man who threatened him one night; Edward torched a boat for money; Alan is the king of substance abuse; Burt's parents have both been in jail since he was 7. But Robb finds that they all have a number of things in common--childhoods fraught with so many uncertainties that they never learned cause and effect, the lack of a father's guidance--the same things, it turn out, that plague Robb's own heart.<p> Robb has a gift for evoking their natural surroundings on the island in a language that resembles poetry while capturing the cadences and tribulations of his surly yet charming students with perfect pitch and clear-eyed sympathy. Not only does the dichotomy make for compelling reading, it works on the kids as well: Ned, the longhaired metalhead, gives CPR to a mouse and actually revives it; Wyatt, who stole cars out of boredom, considers his absent father's legacy after reading a Gary Snyder poem. Robb is a literary voyager in the most unlikely of places, and, in the end, reveals that even boys such as these have a poetry all their own. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><b>Daniel Robb,</b> a carpenter and writer, has been an editor of academic journals; a teacher in Mississippi, New York, and Massachusetts; a political consultant; and the proprietor of a literary services business.

A senior scholar of this epoch, F. W. Mote highlights the personal characteristics of the rulers and dynasties and probes the cultural theme of Chinese adaptations to recurrent alien rule. No other work provides a similar synthesis: generational events, personalities, and the spirit of the age combine to yield a comprehensive history of the civilization, not isolated but shaped by its relation to outsiders. This vast panorama of the civilization of the largest society in human history reveals much about Chinese high and low culture, and the influential role of Confucian philosophical and social ideals. Throughout the Liao Empire, the world of the Song, the Mongol rule, and the early Qing through the Kangxi and Qianlong reigns, culture, ideas, and personalities are richly woven into the fabric of the political order and institutions. This is a monumental work that will stand among the classic</p><p>A major preoccupation of this work by Princeton's highly respected professor emeritus, Frederick W. Mote, is the interplay between China and Inner Asia, a region that includes Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet. This is an important advance on previous broad examinations of imperial China, which have a distinct bias toward sinocentric dynastic politics. The year 907 marked the final breakdown of the Tang government and the establishment of a series of non-Chinese dynasties, from the Liao to the Qing, who ruled over all or much of Chinese territory for the next thousand years. Mote explains the impact on China of the Turkic and Mongol tribes to the north and west, a cultural influence that, for political reasons, is normally neglected by Chinese historians. The book's many excellent maps show how China's boundaries were constrained by powerful neighbors, a fact that also has political significance today. Economic questions are discussed, such as transportation systems and trade with the northern tribes. Environmental issues, such as the silting and flooding of the Yellow River, firmly insert geography into historical studies. Meanwhile, the next edition--and there will surely be another edition--will benefit from a standardized modern romanization of such languages as Mongolian.<p> <i>Imperial China 900-1800</i> represents the distillation of a lifetime's study by a senior scholar steeped in Chinese history, yet it incorporates recent archaeological discoveries and is up to date, even radical, in its concepts. The author has the stature and confidence to avoid compulsive footnoting without losing credibility, which assists the easy unfolding of the book's narrative and analysis. This excellent work will stimulate the general reader and be an extremely useful text for the next generation of students of Chinese history. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p>A personal meditation on the later imperial history of China by an author who studied and taught the subject all his life and whose knowledge of it is truly formidable.

Sally Blanchard&#39;s Companion Parrot Handbook not only tells you what to do but also tells you why and how!&#34;Sally Blanchard&#39;s name is one of the most well recognized among parrot lovers. This reputation is well deserved, for her contributions to our body of knowledge about the proper care and behavior of companion parrots have revolutionized our theories of how to live successfully and happily with our household birds. Early in her life, Sally combined her fascination with birds and her artistic abilities when she developed a career as a bird sculptor. As her focus shifted gradually to exotic birds, she made the transition into a full-time career working with parrots. Her first articles appeared in Bird Talk magazine in 1988. In 1991, she established the Pet Bird Information Council, Inc. and began publishing the &#34;Pet Bird Report: The Companion Parrot Magazine&#34;. Since then, the PBR has provided parrot owners with the most current information on what it&#39;s really like to have parrots as day-to-day companions and how to do so successfully. For over two decades, Sally Blanchard&#39;s work with parrot behavior has shaped thinking, spurred debate and served to raise the standards for their keeping. Her approach to this has always been unique, as she encourages parrot owners to view their birds as sentient companions and to understand their roles as parrot caregivers. She was the first to emphasize the need to base all principles and practices on building trust between parrot and caregiver. Her information consistently inspires happier relationships between people and their parrots. Today, Sally shares her home in Alameda, California with several companion parrots, three dogs and two cats. She continues to publish the Pet Bird Report magazine and work as an avian behavior consultant. She is also currently working on other parrot-related books, one concerning the different parrot personality profiles, and the second focusing on African Greys.</p><h2>Primary Mathematics 2B, Teacher&#39;s Guide, Standards Edition</h2><p>Designed to equip students with a strong foundation in mathematics and critical thinking skills.</p><p></p><h2>Healing PCOS: A 21-Day Plan for Reclaiming Your Health and Life with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2><p><p>A proven 21-day diet and lifestyle plan to help women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) take back control of their health and resolve their symptoms from a certified health coach and founder of the large PCOS Diva online community.</p><p>PCOS is one of the most common hormonal disorders, and the most common cause of female infertility, affecting roughly&nbsp;five million American women.

He joined the Royal Navy at fifteen, before transferring to the Royal Australian Navy when his family emigrated. He served in the Far East, Antarctic waters, the South Seas, and in Vietnam, where he saw active service in a carrier task force. After university, he became a teacher and an educational psychologist and lived for a number of years in Hong Kong, where he was commissioned into the Royal Naval Reserve and received Britain's MBE award. He retired with the rank of lieutenant commander. <i>Seaflower</i> is Julian Stockwin's third novel in the Kydd series, following <i>Kydd</i> and <i>Artemis.</i> He lives in Devon, England, with his wife, Kathy, where he is at work on the fourth Kydd adventure, <i>Mutiny.</i> Visit Julian Stockwin's Web site at www.julianstockwin.com<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> The low thud of a court-martial gun echoed over Portsmouth in the calm early-summer morning, the grim sound telling the world of the naval drama about to take place. Its ominous portent also stilled the conversation on the fore lower-deck of the old receiving ship lying farther into the harbor. There, Thomas Kydd's pigtail was being reclubbed by his closest friend and shipmate, Nicholas Renzi. </p><p> "I wish in m' bowels it were you," Kydd said, in a low voice. He was dressed in odd-fitting but clean seaman's gear. Like Renzi, he was a shipwrecked mariner and his clothes were borrowed. A court-martial would try the sole surviving officer, and Kydd, who had been on watch at the helm at the time, was a principal witness. </p><p> There was a muffled hail at the fore hatchway. Kydd made a hasty farewell, and clattered up the broad ladder to muster at the ship's side. The larboard cutter bobbed alongside to embark the apprehensive witnesses. In the curious way of the Navy, Kydd joined diffidently with the petty officers, even though with the death of his ship his acting rate had been removed and therefore he was borne on the books of the receiving ship as an able seaman. His testimony, however, would be given as a petty officer, his rate at the time. </p><p> The pleasant boat trip to the dockyard was not appreciated by Kydd, who gulped at the thought of crusty, gold-laced admirals and captains glaring at him as he gave his evidence, which might well be challenged by other hostile officers. </p><p> In fact recently it had not in any way been a pleasant time for Kydd and Renzi. Their return as shipwrecked sailors to the land of their birth had been met with virtual imprisonment in a receiving ship; at a time of increasingly solemn news from the war it was a grave problem for the authorities how to announce the loss of the famous frigate <i>Artemis.</i> Their response had been to keep the survivors from the public until a course of action had been decided after the court-martial, with the result that both Kydd and Renzi had not been able to return home after their long voyage. As far as could be known, their loved ones had had no news of them since the previous year, and that from Macao, their last touching at civilization. </p><p> The cutter headed for the smart new stone buildings of the dockyard. The last half of the century had seen a massive expansion of capability in the foremost royal dockyard of the country, and it was a spectacle in its own right, the greatest industrial endeavor in the land. As they neared the shore, Kydd nervously took in the single Union Flag hanging from the signal tower. This was the evidence for all eyes of the reality of a court-martial to be held here, ashore, by the Port Admiral. The court would normally meet in the Great Cabin of the flagship, but the anchorage at Spithead was virtually empty, Admiral Howe's fleet somewhere out in the Atlantic looking for the French. </p><p> The marine sentries at the landing place stood at ease -- there were no officers in the boat needing a salute, only an odd-looking lot of seamen in ill-fitting sailor rig. There were few words among the men, who obediently followed a lieutenant into an anteroom to await their call. Pointedly, a pair of marines took up position at the entrance. </p><p> It seemed an interminable time to Kydd, as he sat on the wooden chair, his hat awkwardly in his hand. The voyage across the vast expanse of the Pacific and the early responsibility of promotion thrust on him had considerably matured him, and anyone who glanced at his tanned, open face, thick dark hair and powerful build could never have mistaken him for anything other than what he was, a prime seaman. His past as a perruquier in Guildford town was now unimaginably distant. </p><p> "Abraham Smith," called a black-coated clerk at the door. The carpenter's mate stood and limped off, his face set. Kydd remembered his work on the foredeck of <i>Artemis</i> in the stormy darkness. Men here owed their lives to the raft he had fashioned from wreckage and launched in the cold dawn light. </p><p> The clerk returned. "Tobias Stirk." The big gunner got to his feet, then he paused deliberately and looked back at Kydd. His grave expression did not vary, but his slow wink caused Kydd to smile. Then he thought of the trial, and his heart thudded. </p><p> "Thomas Kydd." </p><p> Kydd followed the clerk, emerging into a busy room where he was handed over to another. Expecting at any moment to appear before the great court, Kydd was confused to be led upstairs to a much smaller room, bare but for a large table. At a chair on the opposite side was a senior official wearing a grave expression, who motioned him to sit down. A junior clerk entered and took up position at a smaller table. </p><p> "Thomas Paine Kydd?" </p><p> Kydd nodded, too nervous to speak. </p><p> "My name is Gardiner. We are here to determine the facts pertaining to the loss of His Majesty's Frigate <i>Artemis</i>," the lawyer announced, with practiced ease. "Your deposition of evidence will be taken here, and examined to see if it has relevance to the case soon before the court." </p><p> Perhaps he would not have to appear in court at all. He might be released and allowed home -- but then reason told him that his contribution was a vital piece of evidence. He and Renzi had discussed their respective positions. Renzi was a self-exile with a well-born past, serving "sentence" for a family crime, and had a more worldly view. Kydd had a stubborn belief in the rightness of truth, and would not shift his position by an inch. The result of his stand would be inevitable. </p><p> "Were you, Kydd, on watch on the night of the thirteenth of April, 1794?" Gardiner began mildly, shuffling papers, as the clerk scratched away with his quill off to the side. </p><p> "Aye, sir, quartermaster o' the starb'd watch, at the helm." The man would probably think it impertinent of him were he to volunteer that, as quartermaster, he would never have deigned to touch the wheel -- that was the job of the helmsman. He had been in overall charge of the helm as a watch-station under the officer-of-the-watch, and as such was probably the single most valuable witness to what had really happened that night. </p><p> A pause and a significant look between Gardiner and the clerk showed that the point had in fact been caught. </p><p> "As quartermaster?" The voice was now sharply alert. </p><p> "Acting quartermaster, sir." </p><p> "Very well." Gardiner stared at him for a while, the gray eyes somewhat cruel. His musty wig reeked of law, judgment and penalty. "Would it be true or untrue to state that you were in a position to understand the totality of events on the quarterdeck that night?" </p><p> Kydd paused as he unraveled the words. The junior clerk's quill hung motionless in the dusty air. Kydd knew that any common seaman who found himself afoul of the system would be lost in its coils, hopelessly enmeshed in unfathomable complication. Renzi, with his logic, would have known how to answer, but he had been asleep below at the time and had not been called as a witness. </p><p> Looking up, Kydd said carefully, "Sir, the duty of a quartermaster is th' helm, an' he is bound to obey th' officer-o'-the-watch </p><p> in this, an' stand by him f'r orders. That was L'tenant Rowley, sir." </p><p> Lines deepened between Gardiner's eyes. "My meaning seems to have escaped you, Kydd. I will make it plainer. I asked whether or not you would claim to be in a position to know all that happened." </p><p> It was an unfair question, and Kydd suspected he was being offered the option to withdraw gracefully from the hazard of being a key witness open to hostile questioning from all quarters. He had no idea why. </p><p> "I was never absent fr'm my place o' duty, sir," he said quietly. </p><p> "Then you are saying that you can of a surety be relied upon to state just why your ship was lost?" The disbelief bordered on sarcasm. </p><p> "Sir, there was a blow on that night, but I could hear L'tenant Rowley's words -- every one!" he said, with rising anger. </p><p> Gardiner frowned and threw a quick glance at the clerk, who had not resumed scratching. "I wonder if you appreciate the full implications of what you are saying," he said, with a steely edge to his voice. </p><p> Kydd remained mute, and stared back doggedly. He would speak the truth -- nothing more or less. </p><p> "Are you saying that simply because you could hear Lieutenant Rowley you can tell why your ship was lost?" The tone was acid, but hardening. </p><p> "Sir." Kydd finally spoke, his voice strengthening. "We sighted breakers fine to wind'd," he said, and recalled the wild stab of fear that the sudden frantic hail there in the open Atlantic had prompted. "L'tenant Rowley ordered helm hard a'weather, and -- " </p><p> Gardiner interjected. "By that I assume he immediately and correctly acted to turn the ship away from the hazard?" </p><p> Kydd did not take the bait. "The ship bore away quickly off th' wind, but L'tenant Parry came on deck and gave orders f'r the helm to go hard down -- " </p><p> Gardiner struck like a snake. "But Parry was not officer-of-the-watch, he did not have the ship!" His head thrust forward aggressively. </p><p> "Sir, L'tenant Parry was senior t' L'tenant Rowley, an' he could -- " </p><p> "But he was not officer-of-the-watch!" Gardiner drew in his breath. </p><p> Kydd felt threatened by his strange hostility. The lawyer was there to find the facts, not make it hard for witnesses, especially one who could explain it all. </p><p> "But he <i>was</i> right, sir!" </p><p> Gardiner tensed, but did not speak. </p><p> The truth would set matters right, Kydd thought, and he had had an odd regard for the plebeian Parry, whom he had seen suffer so much from the dandy Rowley. He was dead now, but Kydd would make sure his memory was not betrayed. "Ye should put the helm <i>down</i> when y' sees a hazard, that way th' ship is taken aback." He saw a guarded incomprehension on Gardiner's face, and explained further so there would be no mistake on this vital point. "That way, the ship stops in th' water, stops fr'm getting into more trouble till you've worked out what t' do." </p><p> "And you allege that Lieutenant Rowley's act -- to go away from the hazard -- was the wrong one?" Gardiner snapped. </p><p> "Aye, sir!" Kydd's certainty seemed to unsettle Gardiner, who muttered something indistinct, but waited. </p><p> "We sighted breakers next to loo'ard, an' because L'tenant Rowley had come off the wind, they were fast coming in under our lee an' no time to stay about!" </p><p> There was a breathy silence. Gardiner's face hardened. "You are alleging that the loss of <i>Artemis</i> was directly attributable to this officer's actions?" </p><p> There was now no avoiding the issue. He must stand by his words, which he must repeat at length in court, or abjectly deny them. "Yes, sir!" he said firmly. </p><p> Gardiner leaned back slowly, fixing Kydd with his hard eyes. Unexpectedly, he sighed. "Very well, we will take your deposition." </p><p> There was a meaningful cough from the clerk. Gardiner turned slightly and something passed between them that Kydd was unable to catch. Resuming his gaze Gardiner added, "And in your own words, if you please." </p><p> Concentrating with all his might, Kydd told the simple story of the destruction of the crack frigate, from the first chilling sight of breakers in mid-Atlantic to her inevitable wrecking on an outer ledge of rock on one of the islands of the Azores. </p><p> But he said nothing of the personal heartbreak he felt at the death of the first ship he had really loved, the ship that had borne him around the world to so many adventures, that had turned him from tentative sailor to first-class seaman and petty officer. He also omitted the story of the nightmare of the break-up of the wreck during the night and his desperate swim for his life among the relentless breakers, the joy at finally finding himself alive. Those details would not interest these legal gentlemen. </p><p> "Thank you," said Gardiner, and glanced at the clerk, whose hand flew across the paper as he transcribed Kydd's words. "It seems complete enough." His detachment was a mystery after the savage inquisition of before. </p><p> The clerk finished, sanded the sheet and shuffled it in together with the rest. "Ye'll need to put y'r mark on each page," he said offhandedly. </p><p> Kydd bristled. He had debated Diderot and Rousseau in the Great South Sea with Renzi, and never felt himself an unlettered foremast hand. He dashed off a distinguished signature on each page. </p><p> "You may return to your ship," said Gardiner neutrally, standing. Kydd rose also, satisfied with the catharsis of at last telling his tale. "We will call upon your testimony as the court decides," Gardiner added. Kydd nodded politely and left. </p><p> *�&nbsp;�&nbsp;*�&nbsp;�&nbsp;* </p><p> Renzi sat on the sea chest he shared with Kydd. They had lost everything in the shipwreck, nothing to show for their great voyage around the world. Kydd was fashioning a trinket box from shipwright's offcuts and bone inlay to present to his adoring sister when he finally made his way up the London road to the rural peace of Guildford. </p><p> "Nicholas, you'll be right welcome at home, m' friend, y' know, but have ye given thought t' your folks?" </p><p> Renzi looked up from his book, his eyes opaque. "I rather fancy my presence will not be as altogether a blessed joy as yours will be to your own family, dear fellow." He did not elaborate and Kydd did not pursue it. The sensibilities that had led to Renzi's act of self-exile from his family were not to be discussed, but Kydd was aware that in becoming a common sailor Renzi could only be regarded as a wanton disgrace by his well-placed family. </p><p> Renzi added casually, "If it does not disoblige, it would give me particular joy to bide awhile <i>chez</i> Kydd." He didn't find it necessary to say that this would renew his acquaintance of Cecilia, Kydd's handsome sister. </p><p> Kydd sighed happily. "I told 'em everythin', Nicholas -- I say my piece afore the court, an' we're on our way home!" His keen knife shaved a thin sliver from the lid, rounding the edge. </p><p> Renzi looked at his friend. Kydd's account of his questioning was disturbing. In his bones he felt unease. </p><p> "Yes indeed, and we shall -- " He broke off. Above the comfortable patter of shipboard noises a faint thud had sounded, as of a light-caliber cannon in the distance. Activity ceased on the lower-deck as men strained to hear. Another thud. Eyes met -- random gunfire in a naval anchorage was unusual to the point of incredible. Some got to their feet, faces hardening. A move to the hatchway turned into a rush as a third shot was heard. </p><p> On deck all attention was on the harbor entrance. Officers on the quarterdeck had telescopes trained and tense chatter spread. Some men leaped for the foreshrouds to get a better view. </p><p> It was a naval cutter under a full press of sail, flying through the narrow entrance of the harbor, an enormous ensign streaming and some sort of signal on both shrouds. A white puff appeared on her fo'c'sle, the thump arriving seconds later. </p><p> "Despatches -- she's a packet boat," Stirk growled. "An' goin' rapful -- she's got some noos fer us, mates!" he said, with u...</p></p><h2>King Nimrod&#39;s Tower</h2><p>Against a background of the building of the Tower of Babel, a boy tries to train a stray dog--and God watches over all.</p><p></p><h2>The Canoe and the Saddle: A Critical Edition</h2><p>In 1853, with money in his pocket and elegant clothes in his saddlebags, a twenty-four-year-old New Englander of aristocratic Yankee stock toured the territories of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. <i>The Canoe and the Saddle</i> recounts Theodore Winthrop&#x2019;s Northwest tour. A novelized memoir of his travels, it became a bestseller when it was published shortly after the author&#x2019;s untimely death in the Civil War. <p>This critical edition of Winthrop&#x2019;s work, the first in over half a century, offers readers the original text with a narrative overview of the nature and culture of the Pacific Northwest and reflections on the ecological and racial turmoil that gripped the region at the time. It also provides a fresh perspective on the aesthetic, historical, cultural, anthropological, social, and environmental contexts in which Winthrop wrote his sometimes disturbing, sometimes enlightening, and always riveting account. Whether offering portraits of Native American culture&#x2014;in particular, commenting on the Chinook Jargon&#x2014;making keen and often prescient observations on nature, or deploying transcendental, animist, or Hudson River School aesthetics (likely learned from his friend Frederick Church), Winthrop develops a clear and compelling picture of a time and place still resonant and relevant today.</p></p><p>Paul J.

Both books take you to Poland's forest primeval, the Bialowieza, and paint a richly textured portrait of a natural world that few of us would recognize. The similarities end there, however, as Ackerman explores how that sense of natural order imploded under the Nazi occupation of Poland. Jan and Antonina Zabiniski--keepers of the Warsaw Zoo who sheltered Jews from the Warsaw ghetto--serve as Ackerman's lens to this moment in time, and she weaves their experiences and reflections so seamlessly into the story that it would be easy to read the book as Antonina's own miraculous memoir. Jan and Antonina's passion for life in all its diversity illustrates ever more powerfully just how narrow the Nazi worldview was, and what tragedy it wreaked. <i>The Zookeeper&#x2019;s Wife</i> is a powerful testament to their courage and--like Irene Nemirovsky's <i>Suite Francaise</i>--brings this period of European history into intimate view.<i> --Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br><p><b>Diane Ackerman</b> is the author of many highly acclaimed works of nonfiction and poetry, including <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i>, <i> </i>a book beloved by millions of readers all over the world, and <i>The Zookeeper's Wife</i>, which received the Orion Book Award.

This book is truly epic, filled with oodles of imagination and entertainment. WINGED REVIEWS 20130607 I was away on the ships and wandering through Ravka with Alina and Mal, I was on the receiving end of his kisses and his annoyances. I felt the sun warm the pages whenever Alina summoned and I felt the fear when The Darkling was around. There is nothing I don't love about the world in which the Grisha trilogy is set and I cannot wait until next year to see how this series is going to conclude. READARAPTOR 20130701 I wrote a piece here gushing about why the Grisha series is so different and so special. There are many small reasons that all come together to create the awesomeness. But there are also many more that I can't even explain. Maybe it is different because it is just magic. It has the most exquisitely constructed world, the best-written characters, the most amazing writing and storyline. And it always always always leaves me desperate for more. It always leaves me aching, foaming at the mouth, for more: right now. And that, perhaps, is why it is so special. It is magic. It is beautiful. It is perfect. Well, except for that cliffhanger. How am I meant to make it a whole year with that hanging over my head?! THE BOOK ADDICTED GIRL 20130702 Leigh Bardugo, you sure know how to involve your readers and make them an emotional wreck.

I love this blend of classic fairytale and modern day. And it always seems to leave me wanting more! And the plot was amazing too. It was just nonstop action, nonstop thrills, nonstop suspense and nonstop excitement. I gobbled it up, falling harder in love each time. And then having my heart totally broken. Numerous times...

Kate Elliott's fantasy sequence has a bleak sadness even in its moments of triumph, simply because her heroes and heroines seem as if they are never going to get the chance to be all they could be. Alan, suddenly adopted heir to the local noble, is obliged to marry an anorexic princess whose hobby of heresy extends to fake stigmata; royal courier Liath and more than slightly deranged royal bastard Sanglant find that their love stands in the way of the King's dynastic plans; the prattish monk Ivar runs away from heresy proceedings and hides among a princeling's boon companions and catamites. And while the nobility juggle marriages and churchmen bicker about doctrine, invaders amass on the borders and the world seems booked for cataclysms both political and metaphysical. Elliott has not yet become as popular as she probably deserves--she has a real sense of what even an imaginary medieval world should be like in its pompous scholarship and simple piety, and her characters are interestingly fluid; place Ivar in a cavalry charge, and he does quite well. This third volume sustains the pace and grim tone of its predecessors in the Crown of Stars sequence. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i>KATE ELLIOTT is the author of many novels, including BLACK WOLVES, COURT OF FIVES, the Spiritwalker trilogy, the Novels of the Jaran, and the Crossroads trilogy.

A young centurion ventures among the hostile tribes beyond the Roman Wall to recover the eagle standard of the Ninth, a legion which mysteriously disappeared under his father&#39;s command.</p><p><p><b>Rosemary Sutcliff</b> (1920-1992) wrote dozens of books for young readers, including her award-winning Roman Britain trilogy, <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i>, <i>The Silver Branch</i>, and <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>, which won the Carnegie Medal. <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> is now a major motion picture, The Eagle, directed by Kevin MacDonald and starring Channing Tatum. Born in Surrey, Sutcliff spent her childhood in Malta and on various other naval bases where her father was stationed. At a young age, she contracted Still's Disease, which confined her to a wheelchair for most of her life. Shortly before her death, she was named Commander of the British Empire (CBE) one of Britain's most prestigious honors. She died in West Sussex, England, in 1992.</p>I&nbsp;Frontier Fort <p>From the Fosseway westward to Isca Dumnoniorum the road was simply a British trackway, broadened and roughly metalled, strengthened by corduroys of logs in the softest places, but otherwise unchanged from its old estate, as it wound among the hills, thrusting farther and farther into the wilderness.</p><p>It was a busy road and saw many travellers: traders with bronze weapons and raw yellow amber in their ponies&#x2019; packs; country folk driving shaggy cattle or lean pigs from village to village; sometimes a band of tawny-haired tribesmen from farther west; strolling harpers and quack-oculists too, or a light-stepping hunter with huge wolf-hounds at his heel; and from time to time a commissariat wagon going up and down to supply the Roman frontier post. The road saw them all, and the cohorts of the Eagles for whom all other travellers must make way.</p><p>There was a cohort of leather-clad auxiliaries on the road today, swinging along at the steady Legion&#x2019;s pace that had brought them down from Isca Silurium at twenty miles a day; the new garrison coming to relieve the old one at Isca Dumnoniorum. On they went, following the road that now ran out on a causeway between sodden marsh and empty sky, now plunged into deep boar-hunted forest, or lifted over bleak uplands where nothing grew save furze and thorn-scrub. On with never a halt nor a change of rhythm, marching Century by Century, the sun bright on the Standard at their head, and the rolling dust-cloud kicked up over the pack-train behind.</p><p>At the head of the column marched the Pilus Prior Centurion, the Cohort Commander, the pride that shone from him showing clearly that this was his first command. They were, he had long since decided, a command worthy of anyone&#x2019;s pride; six hundred yellow-haired giants recruited from the tribes of Upper Gaul, with the natural fighting power of mountain cats, drilled and hammered into what he firmly believed to be the finest Auxiliary Cohort ever to serve with the Second Legion. They were a newly joined Cohort; many of the men had not yet proved themselves in action, and the spear-shaft of their Standard had no honours on it, no gilded laurel wreath nor victor&#x2019;s crown. The honours were all to win&#x2014;perhaps during his command.</p><p>The Commander was a complete contrast to his men: Roman to his arrogant fingertips, wiry and dark as they were raw-boned and fair. The olive-skinned face under the curve of his crested helmet had not a soft line in it anywhere&#x2014;a harsh face it would have been, but that it was winged with laughter lines, and between his level black brows showed a small raised scar that marked him for one who had passed the Raven Degree of Mithras.</p><p>Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila had seen little of the Eagles until a year ago. His first ten years had been lived quietly with his mother on the family farm near Clusium, while his father soldiered in Judaea, in Egypt, and here in Britain. They had been going to join his father in Britain, but before the time came for them to do so, rebellion had flared up among the northern tribes, and the Ninth Hispana, his father&#x2019;s Legion, had marched north to deal with it, and never came marching back.</p><p>His mother had died soon afterward, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband. Marcus had loathed the official, and the official had loathed Marcus. They saw everything with different eyes. Marcus came of a line of soldiers&#x2014;one of those Equestrian families who, when the rest of their kind had turned from soldiering to trade and finance, had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence. The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus&#x2019;s. Neither of them had a shred of understanding for each other&#x2019;s ideas, and they had both been thankful when Marcus was eighteen and could apply for a centurion&#x2019;s commission.</p><p>Marcus, his eyes narrowed into the sun as he marched, smiled to himself a little wryly, as he remembered how almost pathetically thankful that plump official had been. (Tramp, tramp, tramp, said the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>He had asked to be sent to Britain, though it meant starting in an auxiliary cohort instead of a line-of-battle one, partly because his father&#x2019;s elder brother had settled there when his own years of soldiering were done, but mostly because of his father. If ever anything became known of the lost Legion, it would be known first in Britain, and it might even be that here in Britain he would find out something for himself.</p><p>Marching down the Isca Dumnoniorum road in the run-honey evening light, he found himself thinking about his father. He had very vivid memories of a slight, dark man with laughter lines at the corners of his eyes, who had come home from time to time, and taught him to fish, to play &#x201c;Flash the Fingers,&#x201d; and throw a javelin. He remembered vividly that last leave of all. His father had just been appointed to command the First Cohort of the Hispana, which meant having charge of the Eagle and being something very like second-in-command of the Legion besides; and he had been like a jubilant boy about it. But his mother had been faintly anxious, almost as if she knew...</p><p>&#x201c;If it was any other Legion!&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;You have told me yourself that the Hispana has a bad name.&#x201d;</p><p>And his father had replied: &#x201c;But I would not have it any other Legion if I could. I held my first command in the Hispana, and a man&#x2019;s first Legion is apt to hold chief place in his heart ever after, be its name good or bad; and now that I go back to it as First Cohort, we will see whether there is nothing can be done to better its name.&#x201d; He had turned to his small son, laughing. &#x201c;Presently it will be your turn. It has fallen on evil days, but we will make a Legion of the Hispana yet, you and I.&#x201d;</p><p>Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father&#x2019;s eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.</p><p>(Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the sound of the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>It would be pleasant, he thought, if Uncle Aquila was like his father. He had not met his uncle yet; after learning his foot-drill he had arrived in Britain in the sleety days of late autumn, and been sent straight up to Isca; but he had a rather vague invitation to spend his leave with him at Calleva, when he had any leave to spend. It would be very pleasant if Uncle Aquila was like his father.</p><p>Not of course that he and his uncle were likely to have much to do with each other. In a few years&#x2019; time he would probably be serving in quite a different part of the Empire, since a Cohort Centurion seldom moved up all the way in the same Legion.</p><p>All the way...from his present rank right up to his father&#x2019;s rank of First Cohort; and after that? For most of the men who got so far there was nothing after that, but for the outstanding few who went further&#x2014;as Marcus intended to go further&#x2014;the ways divided there. One could become a Camp Commandant, as Uncle Aquila had done, or one could go on, by way of the Praetorian Guard, to try for command of a Legion. Legion Commanders were almost always men of Senator&#x2019;s rank, with no experience of soldiering save a year&#x2019;s service as Military Tribune in their youth; but by long custom the two Egyptian Legions were exceptions to the rule. They were commanded by professional soldiers; and an Egyptian Legion had been Marcus&#x2019;s shining goal for as long as he could remember.</p><p>But one day, when he had finished with the Eagles, when he had made an honourable name and become Prefect of his Egyptian Legion, he would go home to the Etruscan hills, and perhaps even buy back the old farm, which the plump official had ruthlessly sold to defray expenses. For a moment he remembered almost painfully the sunlit courtyard flickered over with the shadow of pigeons&#x2019; wings, and the wild olive tree in the loop of the stream, on a twisted root of which he had once found a kind of gall growing, that was shaped something like a little bird. He had cut it from the root with the new knife his father had given him, and spent much loving care, all one absorbed summer evening, trimming and carving feathers on it. He had that little bird still.</p><p>The road topped a gentle rise, and suddenly Isca Dumnoniorum lay before them, with the fortress-crowned Red Mount dark with shadows against the evening sky; and Marcus came back to the present with a jerk. The farm in the Etruscan hills could wait until he was old and tired and famous; in the present was the glory of his first command.</p><p>The British town was spread below the southern scarp of the Mount; a sprawling huddle of reed-thatched roofs, every colour from the gold of honey to the black of dried peat, according to the age of the thatch; with the squared, clean lines of the Roman forum and basilica looking oddly rootless in their midst; and the faint haze of woodsmoke lying over all.</p><p>The road led straight through the town and up to the cleared slope beyond, to the Praetorian gate of the fort; here and there, crimson-or saffron-cloaked men turned to look at the cohort as it swung by, a look that was reserved rather than hostile. Dogs sat scratching in odd corners, lean pigs rooted among the garbage piles, and women with bracelets of gold or copper on very white arms sat in hut doorways, spinning, or grinding corn. The blue smoke of many cooking-fires curled up into the quiet air, and the savoury smell of many evening meals mingled with the blue reek of woodsmoke and the sharper tang of horse-droppings, which Marcus had by now come to associate with all British towns. Little that was Roman was here as yet, despite the stone-built forum. One day there would be straight streets, he supposed, and temples and bathhouses and a Roman way of life. But as yet it was a place where two worlds met without mingling: a British town huddled under the dominion of the turf ramparts where once the tribe had had its stronghold and now the Roman sentries paced up and down. He looked about him under the curve of his helmet as he marched, knowing that this place would be part of his life for the next year; then looked up to the turf ramparts, and saw a Roman banner drooping in the still air and the tall crest of a sentry burning in the sunset, and heard a trumpet-call ring out, as it seemed, from the fiery sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You have brought clear skies with you,&#x201d; said Centurion Quintus Hilarion, lounging in the window of the Commander&#x2019;s quarters, and peering into the night. &#x201c;But Hercle! you need not expect it to last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As bad as that?&#x201d; said Centurion Marcus Aquila, who was seated on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Quite as bad as that! It rains always, here in the west, save when Typhon, the father of all ills, brews up a mist to come between a man and his own feet. By the time you have served your year here you will have toadstools sprouting out of your ears, the same as me, and not from the damp alone!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From what besides?&#x201d; enquired Marcus with interest. &#x201c;Oh, lack of company, for one thing. I am a sociable soul myself; I like my friends around me.&#x201d; He turned from the window, and folded up on to a low cushioned bench, hugging his knees. &#x201c;Ah well, I am off to rub away the blue mould as soon as I have marched the troops back to Isca.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Going on leave?&#x201d;</p><p>The other nodded. &#x201c;Long leave, lovely leave, among the flesh-pots of Durinum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Durinum&#x2014;that is your home?&#x201d; asked Marcus. &#x201c;Yes. My father retired and settled there a few years ago. There is a surprisingly good circus, and plenty of people&#x2014;pretty girls too. A pleasant enough place to get back to, out of the wilds.&#x201d; An idea seemed to strike him. &#x201c;What shall you do when your leave falls due? I suppose, coming out from home, you have no one here to go to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have an uncle at Calleva, though I have not yet met him,&#x201d; Marcus said, &#x201c;and certainly there is no one at home I should want to spend my leave with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Father and mother both dead?&#x201d; enquired Hilarion with friendly interest.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. My father went with the Ninth Legion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pericol! You mean when they&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Disappeared. Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. That is bad!&#x201d; said Hilarion, wagging his head. &#x201c;A deal of ugly stories, there were&#x2014;still are, for that matter; and of course, they did lose the Eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>Instantly Marcus was up in arms to defend his father and his father&#x2019;s Legion. &#x201c;Since not a man of the Legion came back, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that neither did the Eagle,&#x201d; he flashed.</p><p>&#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; agreed Hilarion amicably. &#x201c;I was not blowing on your father&#x2019;s honour, so you can keep your feathers on, my Marcus.&#x201d; He looked up at the other with a wide, friendly grin, and suddenly Marcus, who had been ready to quarrel with him the instant before, found himself grinning back.</p><p>It was several hours since Marcus had marched his Cohort across the hollow-ringing bridge, answering the sentry&#x2019;s challenge, &#x201c;Fourth Gaulish Auxiliaries of the Second Legion, come to relieve this garrison.&#x201d; Dinner was over, in the officers&#x2019; mess, with the Quartermaster, the Surgeon, and the double complement of ranker Centurions. Marcus had taken charge of the pay-chest keys&#x2014;in a garrison as small as this there was no paymaster; and for the past hour, here in the Commander&#x2019;s quarters in the Praetorium, he and Hilarion had been going through the office work of the frontier fort. Now, crested helmets and embossed breastplates laid aside, the two of them were taking their ease.</p><p>Through the doorless opening Marcus could see almost the whole of the sleeping-cell, the narrow cot piled with gay native rugs, the polished oaken chest, the lamp-bracket high on the bare wall, and nothing more. The outer room held the battered writing table on which Marcus was sitting, a cross-legged camp-stool, the cushioned bench to represent comfort, another chest for the record rolls, and a bronze pedestal lamp of peculiarly hideous design.</p><p>In the little silence that had fallen between them, Marcus looked round him at the austere room in the yellow flood of lamplight, and to him it seemed beautiful. But though it would be his tomorrow, for this one night he was a guest here, and he looked back to his host with a quick smile of apology for having looked too soon at his surroundings with the eye of mastery.</p><p>Hilarion grinned. &#x201c;You will not be feeling like that this day next year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; said Marcus, swinging one sandalled foot and idly watching the swing of it. &#x201c;What does one do here, besides growing toadstools? Is there good hunting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough; it is the one thing to be said for this particular corner of the Empire. Boar and wolf in the winter, and the forest swarms with deer. There are several hunters below in the town, who will take you out for the price of the day&#x2019;s work. Unwise to go alone, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcus nodded. &#x201c;Have you any advice for me? I am new to this country.&#x201d;</p><p>The other considered. &#x201c;No, I think not.&#x201d; Then he sat up with a jerk. &#x201c;Yes, I have, if no one has warned you already. But it has nothing to do with the hunting. It is the priest-kind&#x2014;the wandering Druids. If one of them appears in the district, or you get the least idea that there is one about, look to your weapons. Good advice, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Druids?&#x201d; Marcus was surprised and puzzled. &#x201c;But surely Suetonius Paulinus dealt with them once and for all, sixty years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As an organized priesthood, maybe; but as easily hold off these heathen mists with a palm-leaf umbrella as end the Druids by destroying their strong...</p></p><h2>Healing with the Medicine of the Prophet</h2><p>&#34;Healing with the Medicine of the Prophet (pbuh)&#34; is the panacea for those in search of good health. It is a magnificent work that is a treasure for every household. Although it was written by the author, Ibn Al-Qayyim, over six hundred and fifty years ago, it is an extremely timely work for our generation in which health and natural health care products have become an important aspect of the lives of so many.The author presents the guidance of the Prophet (pbuh) in dealing with a variety of health issues, including treatment of ailments and preventive remedies to keep the body fit. As the Qur&#39;an and Sunnah (traditions of Muhammad (pbuh)) are the main sources of the Islamic lifestyle, it only stands to reason that they should likewise be referred to in the matters of health and fitness. This is the approach taken by Ibn Al-Qayyim as he presents Verses of the Qur&#39;an, and statements of the Prophet (pbuh) as his main reference in these issues of health and medicines. The final chapters of this work include an extremely beneficial glossary of remedies, herbs, foods and other natural substances that aid in the journey towards better health.&#34; Healing with the Medicine of the Prophet (pbuh)&#34; is an invaluable reference guide for the Muslims of every land and every generation. May Allah bestow His mercy and blessings upon the author, Ibn Al-Qayyim, for surely his work will be cherished throughout time.</p><p></p><h2>The History of the Peloponnesian War</h2><p>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it. This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian world&#x2014;I had almost said of mankind. For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately preceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

This book offers a sampling of her acclaimed gardening columns from the London Observer, grouped here by the months of the year. Sackville-West covered everything from the genesis of her white and gray summer garden to humorous ways to ward off birds (including "potatoes stuck with pheasants' feathers"). She didn't mince words ("one of the secrets of good gardening is to remove, ruthlessly, any plant one does not like"), yet was a poet at heart ("The flowers of Magnolia grandiflora look like great white pigeons settling among dark leaves"). Her vivid prose and fresh insights into gardening make this book a delight for armchair and active gardeners alike. There are lovely color drawings of some plants that she mentions and color photographs of her award-winning gardens, which still thrive at her home, 500-year-old Sissinghurst Castle. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introducing Aunt Dimity, Paranormal Detective: The First Two Books in the Beloved Series (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p><b>An irresistible introduction to everyone's favorite bestselling cozy mystery series.&nbsp;Watch out for Nancy Atherton's latest,&nbsp;<i><b>Aunt Dimity and the Widow's Curse</b></i>, coming in May 2017 from Viking!<br></b><br><br> Over the course of her <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, Nancy Atherton's Aunt Dimity has become enormously popular.

Not because she was dead, but because I had never known she&#x2019;d been alive.</p><p>Maybe I should explain.</p><p>When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me stories. She would tuck me in, sit Reginald in her lap, and spin tale after tale until my eyelids drooped and I nodded off to sleep. She would then tuck Reginald in beside me, so that his would be the first face I saw when I opened my eyes again come morning.</p><p>Reginald was my stuffed rabbit. He had once had two button eyes and a powder-pink flannel hide, but he had gone blind and gray in my service, with a touch of purple near his hand-stitched whiskers, a souvenir of the time I&#x2019;d had him try my grape juice. (He spit it out.) He stood nine inches tall and as far as I knew, he had appeared on earth the same day I had, because he had been at my side forever. Reginald was my confidant and my companion in adventure&#x2014;he was the main reason I never felt like an only child.</p><p>My mother found Reginald useful, too. She taught third and fourth grade at an elementary school on the northwest side of Chicago, where we lived, and she knew the value of props. When the world&#x2019;s greatest trampoline expert&#x2014;me&#x2014;refused to settle down at bedtime, she would turn Reginald around on her lap and address him directly. &#x201c;Well, if Lori doesn&#x2019;t want to listen, I&#x2019;ll tell the story to you, Reginald.&#x201d; It worked like a charm every time.</p><p>My mother was well aware that there was nothing I loved more than stories. She read the usual ones aloud: <i>How the Elephant Got Its Trunk, Green Eggs and Ham, The Bluebird of Happiness,</i> and all the others that came from books. But my favorite stories (and Reginald&#x2019;s, too) were the ones she didn&#x2019;t read, the ones that came from her own voice and hands and eyes.</p><p>These were the Aunt Dimity stories. They were the best, my mom&#x2019;s special treat, reserved for nights when even back-scratching failed to soothe me into slumber. I must have been an impossibly restless child, because the Aunt Dimity stories were endless: <i>Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s Cottage, Aunt Dimity in the Garden, Aunt Dimity Buys a Torch,</i> and on and on. My eyes widened with excitement at that last title&#x2014;I was thrilled by the thought of Aunt Dimity preparing to set out for darkest Africa&#x2014;until my mom reduced my excitement (and the size of my eyes) by explaining that, in Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s world, a &#x201c;torch&#x201d; was a flashlight.</p><p>I should have guessed. Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s adventures were never grand or exotic, though they took place in some unnamed, magical land, where a flashlight was a torch, a truck was a lorry (which made Reginald laugh, since that was my name, too), and tea was the sovereign remedy for all ills. The adventures themselves, however, were strictly down-to-earth. Aunt Dimity was the most mundane heroine I had ever encountered, and her adventures were extraordinarily ordinary. Nonetheless, I could never get enough of them.</p><p>One of my great favorites, told over and over again, until I could have told it myself had I wanted to (which I didn&#x2019;t, of course, because my mother&#x2019;s telling was part of the tale), was <i>Aunt Dimity Goes to the Zoo.</i> It began on &#x201c;a beautiful spring day when Aunt Dimity decided to go to the zoo. The daffodils bobbed in the breeze, the sun danced on every windowpane, and the sky was as blue as cornflowers. And when Aunt Dimity got to the zoo, she found out why: All the rain in the world was waiting for her there, gathered in one enormous black cloud which hovered over the zoo and dared her to set foot inside the gate.&#x201d;</p><p>But did that stop Aunt Dimity? Never! She opened her trusty brolly (&#x201c;umbrella,&#x201d; explained my mother), charged into the most drenching downpour in the history of downpours&#x2014;and had a marvelous time. She had the whole zoo to herself and she got to see how all the animals behaved in the rain, how some of them hid in their shelters while others bathed and splashed and shook showers of droplets from their fur. &#x201c;When she&#x2019;d seen all she wanted to see,&#x201d; my mother concluded, &#x201c;Aunt Dimity went home to warm herself before the fire and feast on buttered brown bread and a pot of tea, smiling quietly as she remembered her lovely day at the zoo.&#x201d;</p><p>I suppose what captivated me about Aunt Dimity was her ability to spit in life&#x2019;s eye. Take <i>Aunt Dimity Buys a Torch:</i> Aunt Dimity goes to &#x201c;Harrod&#x2019;s, of all places&#x201d; to buy a flashlight. She makes the mistake of going on the weekend before Christmas, when the store is jam-packed with shoppers and the clerks are all seasonal help who couldn&#x2019;t tell her where the flashlights were even if they had the time, which they don&#x2019;t because of the mad crush, and she winds up never buying the flashlight. For anyone else it would have been a tiresome mistake. For Aunt Dimity, it was just another adventure, one which became more hilarious floor by floor. And in the end she goes home to warm herself before the fire, feast on buttered brown bread and a pot of tea, and chuckle to herself as she remembers her day at Harrod&#x2019;s. Of all places.</p><p>Aunt Dimity was indomitable, in a thoroughly ordinary way. Nothing stopped her from enjoying what there was to enjoy. Nothing kept her from pursuing what she came to pursue. Nothing dampened her spirits because it was <i>all</i> an adventure. I was entranced.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until I was in my early teens that I noticed a resemblance between Aunt Dimity and my mother. Like Aunt Dimity, my mother took great delight in the small things in life. Like her, too, she was blessed with an uncommon amount of common sense. Such gifts would be useful to anyone, but to my mother, they must have proved invaluable. My father had died shortly after I was born, and a lapsed insurance policy had left her in fairly straitened circumstances.</p><p>My mother was forced to sell our house and most of its contents, and to return to teaching much sooner than she&#x2019;d planned. It must have been a wrench to move into a modest apartment, even more of a wrench to leave me with the downstairs neighbor while she went off to work, but she never let it show. She was a single mother before single mothers hit the headlines, and she managed the job very well, if I do say so myself. I never wanted for anything, and when I decided to leave Chicago for college in Boston, she somehow managed to send me, without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation. Around me, she was always cheerful, energetic, and competent. Just like Aunt Dimity.</p><p>My mother was a wise woman, and Aunt Dimity was one of her greatest gifts to me. I can&#x2019;t count the number of times Aunt Dimity rescued me from potential aggravation. Years later, when nearsighted old ladies ran their grocery carts over my toes, I would recall the very large man who had stepped on Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s foot at Harrod&#x2019;s. She guessed his weight to within five pounds. She knew because she subsequently asked him his exact weight, a scene which left me convulsed with giggles every time my mother recounted it. Remembering that, I found myself guessing the eyeglass prescriptions of my grocerycart-wielding little old ladies. Though I never had the nerve to confirm my estimates, the thought made me laugh instead of growl.</p><p>By all accounts, I had a naturally buoyant spirit as a child and the Aunt Dimity stories certainly helped it along. But even naturally buoyant spirits sink at times. Mine took a nosedive when I found myself living the bits that never appeared in the Aunt Dimity stories: the bits when there was no wood for the fire and no butter for the brown bread, when all the lovely days turned dreary. It was nothing unusual, nothing extraordinary or exotic or grand, nothing that hasn&#x2019;t happened a million times to a million people. But this time it happened to me and it all happened at once, with no space for a breath in between. I was on one of those downward spirals that come along every once in a while and suddenly nothing was funny anymore.</p><p>It started when my marriage dissolved, not messily, but painfully nonetheless. By the time we sat down to draw up papers, all I wanted was a quick, clean break&#x2014;and that was all I got. I could have stuck around to fight for property settlements or alimony, but by then I was tired of fighting, tired of sticking around, and, above all, I despised the thought of living <i>off</i> a man I no longer lived <i>with.</i></p><p>I faced the Newly Divorced Woman&#x2019;s Semiobligatory <i>Wanderjahr</i> with no sense of adventure at all. About to turn thirty, I had little money, less energy, and absolutely no idea of what I wanted to do next. Before moving to Los Angeles, where my former husband&#x2019;s job with an accounting firm had taken me, I had worked in the rare book department of my university&#x2019;s library. I moved back to Boston, but by the time I arrived, my old position was gone&#x2014;literally. The humidity control device, installed at great expense to protect the rare book collection from the ravages of time, had gone haywire, causing an electrical fire that no amount of humidity could extinguish. The books had gone up in smoke and so, too, had my prospects for employment.</p><p>Getting a new job in the same field was out of the question. I had no formal library degree, and the curator, at whose knee I had learned more about old books than any six library school graduates combined, was an opinionated maverick. A personal recommendation from Dr. Stanford J. Finderman tended to close doors rather than open them, and I soon discovered that the job market for informally trained rare book specialists was as soft as my head must have been when I&#x2019;d first decided I could make a living as one. Had I known what the future held in store for me, I would have gone to motorcycle mechanics&#x2019; school.</p><p>My mother wanted me to come home to the safe haven of our yellow-brick apartment building in Chicago, but I would have none of that. The only motherly assistance I would accept was a steady supply of home-baked cookies, mailed Federal Express and packed to withstand a nuclear blast.

She introduced me to the wonderful world of temping and as soon as I&#x2019;d registered with a reputable Boston agency, I struck out on my own.

Two weeks after I&#x2019;d moved in, my place was ransacked. The intruder had apparently had a temper tantrum when he discovered that I was just as impoverished as the rest of my neighbors. I came home to an unrecognizable heap of torn clothing, splintered furniture, and a veritable rainbow of foodstuffs smeared decoratively across my walls.</p><p>That was pretty disheartening, but the worst part was finding Reginald. The boon companion of my childhood had been slit from cottontail to whiskers, his stuffing yanked out and strewn about the room. It took me three days to find what remained of his left ear. I interred him in a shoebox, too sickened to attempt his repair, knowing that my clumsy needlework could never match the beautiful stitches that had helped him survive an adventuresome bunnyhood. On the fourth day, shoebox in hand, I moved out, beginning what was to become a long sequence of moves in and out of apartments which, if not exactly squalid, were still a far cry from my predivorce standards of domestic comfort. In April of that year, an ad in the Cambridge <i>Tab</i> led me to share an apartment with two other women in a three-decker on a quiet street in West Somerville. I&#x2019;d just settled in when my mother died.</p><p>There was no warning. The doctor told me that she had died peacefully in her sleep, which helped a little, but not enough.

Who is she?&#x201d; was a question posed in the first fan magazine article published about her in 1925. This first ever biography of the wry and sophisticated actress best known for her role as Nora Charles, wife to dapper detective William Powell in <i>The Thin Man</i>, offers an unprecedented picture of her life and an extraordinary movie career that spanned six decades. Opening with Loy&#x2019;s rough-and-tumble upbringing in Montana, the book takes us to Los Angeles in the 1920s, where Loy&#x2019;s striking looks caught the eye of Valentino, through the silent and early sound era to her films of the thirties, when Loy became a top box office draw, and to her robust post World War II career. Throughout, Emily W. Leider illuminates the actress&#x2019;s friendships with luminaries such as Cary Grant, Clark Gable, and Joan Crawford and her collaborations with the likes of John Barrymore, David O. Selznick, Sam Goldwyn, and William Wyler, among many others. This highly engaging biography offers a fascinating slice of studio era history and gives us the first full picture of a very private woman who has often been overlooked despite her tremendous star power.</p><p>Myrna Loy has found an ideal biographer in Emily Leider, a gifted writer who loves film history and knows how to mine the field for the kind of details that help her paint a full and rounded picture of her subject.&#x201d; Leonard Maltin, film critic/historian<br><br>"A masterful tribute to MGM's subtlest star."

Emily Leider documents both the woman and the actress: the early years in Montana and the multiple and sometimes foolish marriages of the former, and the development of the latter from exotic silent player to sophisticated lead in the <i>Thin Man</i> series to everyone&#x2019;s image of a proud, understanding middle-class wife in the 1940s and beyond.&#x201d; Anthony Slide, author of <i>Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers</i><br>Biographer, poet, and memoirist <b>Emily W.

The large windows overlooked the backyard. She could see the moonlight streaming over the trees and bushes, making long, crazy shadows across the grass. Was there a diamond hidden out there somewhere? She looked at Beatrice, already settled under the covers. She wanted to tell her about the Murphys, but at the same time, she didn't.

So she has the same name as a girl in a book by a dusty old author. Hero is simply not interested in the connections. But that's just the thing; suddenly connections are cropping up all over, and odd characters and uncertain pasts are exactly what do fascinate Hero. There's a mysterious diamond hidden in her new house, a curious woman next door who seems to know an awful lot about it, and then, well, then there's Shakespeare. Not to mention Danny Cordova, only the most popular boy in school. Is it all in keeping with her namesake's origin-just much ado about nothing? Hero, being Hero, is determined to figure it out. </p><p>In this fast-paced novel, Elise Broach weaves an intriguing literary mystery full of historical insights and discoveries.</p><p>A JUNIOR LIBRARY GUILD SELECTION</p></p><p><p><b>Elise Broach</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of books for children and young adults, including <i>Desert Crossing</i> and <i>Masterpiece</i>, as well as several picture books. She lived in England from the ages of twelve to fourteen and vividly remembers her first visit to William Shakespeare's house in Stratford-upon-Avon. At a rare-book store there, she purchased a volume of Shakespeare's plays that she still keeps on her nightstand. Ms. Broach holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in history from Yale University. She was born in Georgia and lives in the woods of rural Connecticut, walking distance from three farms, a library, a post office and two country stores.</p>from <b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br>It was the last day of summer. Hero Netherfield stretched across the quilted bedspread in her sister's room, her feet drifting over the edge of the mattress. She wasn't thinking about their new house. She wasn't thinking about school. She wasn't thinking about stepping off the bus tomorrow into a sea of strangers. If she thought about any of those things, she'd get that old, tight, panicky feeling--and what was the point?<br><br>So instead, she rested her cheek against the soft cotton and breathed. The air was thick with summer smells: lawn clippings and sun lotion and late-blooming roses. She could hear the distant shouts of a tag game down the street. She closed her eyes and made her mind completely blank, as heavy and blank as the summer day.<br><br>It took a lot of concentration. Too much. After a minute, she rolled on her side and said to her sister, "You got the best room."<br><br>Beatrice's room in the new house was full of angles and alcoves, like Hero's, but it was bigger, with more windows. Beatrice had hung posters on the sloping ceiling, and they floated colorfully overhead, like the inside flaps of a circus tent.<br><br>Her sister sat at the desk with one foot propped on an open drawer. She painted her toenails with quick, smooth strokes. "So?" she said. "It was my turn."<br><br>That was true. They took turns choosing bedrooms every time they moved, and Hero had chosen first at the house in New York.<br><br>"You have a good room, too," Beatrice said. "You just need to put stuff up on the walls."<br><br>"Yeah, I know," Hero sighed. But what? She'd finally opened the moving boxes from her old bedroom yesterday. They were filled with stuffed animals, seashells, crunched wildlife posters, all the things she'd collected since she was five. She wasn't sure she even recognized that person any more. None of it belonged in the room of a sixth-grader. A little wistfully, she'd packed it all up again and shoved the boxes in one of the closets under the eaves. That was the strange lthing about moving so often. It forced you to think about starting over every time, whether you really wanted to or not."<br><br>The only things Hero kept out for her new room were her books and a shoebox of antique bottles she'd found at a garage sale, colorful glass vials that once held medicine, hair tonic, maybe perfume. The books she wedged into the dark corner bookcase, stacking a pile of favorites next to her bed. The bottles she arranged in a cluster on the window seat, thinking about all the places they must have been, all the hands that must have held them. She liked the way they caught the sunlight and scattered soft shadows of green and lavender on the floor and walls. But the walls themselves were still completely bare. Hero couldn't think of what to hang on them.<br><br>She rolled onto her stomach and covered her face with her hands. "I can't believe school starts tomorrow."<br><br>"Me neither." Beatrice fanned her toenails. "But maybe it won't be so bad this time."<br><br>"It never is bad for <i>you</i>, Triss."<br><br>Sometimes it amazed Hero that she and her sister were actually part of the same family. When she was little, she used to suspect she was adopted, an idea that struck her as both upsetting and exotic--and somehow much easier to believe than the truth. Beatrice was tall and pretty, with wavy reddish hair and an open, sunny face. She always seemed about to smile, if she wasn't already smiling. Hero, on the other hand, was small and dark. She knew that much of the time, without meaning to, she wore a pinched, worried look. At the grocery store or the mall, complete strangers would touch her arm and ask sympathetically , "What's the matter, honey? Don't you feel well?"<br><br>At school tomorrow, Hero knew exactly what would happen. After a brief sizing-up, Beatrice would be swept into a throng of would-be friends, girls who'd show her the restrooms, save her a place in the cafeteria, share their phone numbers and e-mail addresses. They'd admire her hair, they'd compliment her nail polish. By the end of tomorrow--even though it was only her first day--Beatrice would fit in. Her plans for the weekend would include half the eighth grade.<br><br>For Hero, it would be a different story entirely. She'd still be the new kid months from now. She flinched when she thought of what lay ahead: figuring out the lockers, the right clothing to wear, the acceptable food to pack for lunch. Every school had its own customs and fashions, and if she wanted to blend in, she never had long to find out what they were. Hero frowned, thinking about it. It was such hard work, that constant, draining effort to slip into the crowd unnoticed. "Blending in" was completely different than "fitting in." It was the difference between camouflaging yourself in the forest and actually being one of the trees.<br><br>"Oh, come on, Hero," Beatrice said. "Maryland is almost the South. People seem friendlier here." She laughed suddenly. "Besides, last year everything worked out okay. You had Kate and Lindsey."<br><br>"Ugh!" Hero made a face. "Kate and Lindsey. That was totally not worth it."<br><br>Kate and Lindsey had been her friends in fifth grade. They had identical blond ponytails and high-pitched, unstoppable squeals. Hero had nothing in common with them. It still amazed her that they'd ended up spending so much of the last year together. It was a relationship based purely on need. Kate and Lindsey, struggling not to fail Language Arts, had to find a third person to help with their Greek myths skit. They chose Hero, who ended up writing the whole play while the two of them huddled together and whispered about their one consuming interest, a boy named Jeremy Alexander. They stalked Jeremy throughout the school day, without ever actually talking to him, and then spent hours in endless, inconclusive conversations about whether he knew they even existed. In return for putting up with this, Hero found herself with a lifeline of sorts. She had someone to sit with at lunch, to hang out with at recess, to join for team activities in gym. Of course, if the game ever called for partners, it was understood that the pair would be Kate and Lindsey, and Hero would be on her own.<br><br>"They were awfull," Batrice said, still laughing. "Remember how obsessed they were with that boy?"<br><br>"Remember? That was my life." Hero raised her voice several octaves. "<i>He looked at me!</i> Did not! <i>Did too! In Social Studies!</i> Sideways or did he turn his whole head? <i>Whole head!</i> No way!"<br><br>Beatrice mimicked their ear-splitting scream. "Remember how Dad always used to forget Lindsey's name?" she asked.<br><br>Hero smiled. "He called them 'Kate and the other Kate.' How could he forget a regular name like Lindsey?"<br><br>fi0<br>Beatrice shrugged. "It didn't come from Shakespeare."<br><br>Hero and Beatrice were both named for characters in the play <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, thanks to the English literature class where their parents met in college. Naturally, Beatrice had gotten the familiar name, one that lent itself to bouncy nicknames like Trixie, or Bea, or Triss. Hero's name was inevitably misunderstood, questioned, and laughed at. For several months at the last school, one of her teachers had called her Nero.<br><br>Of course, she hadn't told her parents that. Her mother loved Shakespeare, but her father actually lived it. It was his job. For as long as Hero could remember, he'd been reading, studying, and writing about Shakespeare. When she was little, she used to wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of his voice floating through the darkness. She would pad through the otherwise sleeping house to find him, usually at the dining room table, hunched over the wings of a book, reading out loud. He would always let her listen for a while before he carried her back to bed. The words didn't make any sense--Hero never understood what was happening--but the language was musical and full of feeling. She liked sitting in the dim room and hearing the rhythm of it.<br><br>Her father's years in graduate school and a string of teaching and research jobs had taken them from Illinois to Massachusets to New York, and finally here to Maryland, where he would be working as an archivist at the Maxwell Elizabethan Documents Collection in Washington, D.C. When the whole family had visited the library last week, Hero thought its stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings made it look like a cathedral. It was filled with books and long, shining wood tables. There were glass cases everywhere, with old, curling brown manuscripts in them.<br><br>"Dad seems to love that Maxwell place" she said to Beatrice. "And everybody there looks just like him. Sort of rumpled and tweedy."<br><br>"Yeah," Beatrice said. "Even the women have beards. It's perfect for him."<br><br>It was amazing to think of a place that was perfect for their father. He was so weird, and not just in the way all parents were weird. He used words like "Fie" and "tetchy," and he could quote long passages from Shakespeare by heart. He never did the things that other dads did, like play golf or watch football on TV. He had no idea how to grill a steak. But Beatrice was right: Compared to the rest of the staff at the Maxwell, he seemed normal.<br><br>"Do you think that's how it is for everybody?" Hero asked. "Do you think even the weirdest people seem normal if you put them in the right place?<br><br>Beatrice thought for a minute. "Are you talking about Dad or yourself?"<br><br>Hero grabbed the pillow and hurled it at her, almost knocking over the nail polish.<br><br>"Hey!" Beatrice said. "I was just kidding. Relax, school will go fine tomorrow. You worry too much."<br><br>Hero shook her head. "No, I don't. When you're me, it's not possible to worry too much."<br><br>At that moment, their mother appeared in the doorway. She was holding a large pair of pruning shears, and her cheeks were streaked with sweat. From the expression on her face, they could tell she'd been listening.<br><br>"Well," she said to Hero, "I suppose if you worry <i>too</i> much, you'll always be pleasantly surprised."<br><br>&lt;...</p><h2>The Flower Expert</h2><p>Revised and updated, twice the size--and with over two and a half million copies sold!

Published to accompany a San Francisco Museum of Modern Art exhibition, the photographs in <i>Crossing the Frontier</i> are powerful, vivid, and unsentimental, spanning almost 150 years and including both found images and works by major classic and contemporary photographers. Also featured are essays on the photography, geology, mythology, and architecture of the West by four distinguished authors. In stark contrast to photography books that carefully present nature at its most pristine, Crossing the Frontier finds beauty in the devastation of the terrain, and explores the complex social, political, and cultural ramifications of this transformation.</p><p>The tradition of landscape photography is explored in this volume, published in conjunction with a traveling exhibit conceived and organized by art historian Sandra Phillips. The rapid advance of industrialization is documented, along with the ever-increasing human encroachment on the environment. The photography of land use--as depicted by the work of largely obscure journeymen--is of more weight in this study than the better known tradition of artistic landscape photography represented by Ansel Adams and Edward Weston. The most arresting images are those made by people who have been long forgotten, like George H. Johnson&#39;s daguerreotype of miners laboring on the American River near Sacramento, California.Richard Rodriguez is an on-air essayist for the Newshour with Jim Lehrer, and the author of two memoirs.</p><h2>The Rise of the Shadow Academy</h2><p>Hardback copy of the Star Wars &#34;Young Jedi Knights&#34; subtilte &#39;Rise of the Shadow Academy&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Mark Of A Millionaire</h2><p>An in-depth laser-accurate guide that is right on the money for achieving lasting inner and outer wealth.</p><p></p><h2>At the Heart of Christian Worship: Liturgical Essays of Yves Congar (Pueblo Books)</h2><p><p>Cardinal Yves Congar is universally known and respected as the great ecclesiologist of Vatican II whose seminal ideas helped to reconfigure the landscape of Catholic theology following the council. Less well known is his role in contributing far-reaching insights to the emerging liturgical movement in the church. This collection represents several of Congar's decisive contributions. Reading them makes possible a deeper and more cogent reception of the key ideas of the council documents. These texts are at once both erudite and exciting, both essential and pastorally incisive. There has never been a better time to disseminate these critically important liturgical insights than the present moment.</p></p><p>Yves Congar, OP, who died in 1995, was a French Dominican widely recognized as one of the most important Roman Catholic theologians of the twentieth century and a major influence upon the theology of the documents of Vatican II. Congar drew from biblical, patristic, and medieval sources to revitalize the discipline of contemporary theology. He was an early advocate of ecumenism and also contributed to shaping the theological agenda of the twentieth-century liturgical movement. He was named a cardinal in 1994 by Pope John Paul II. Liturgical Press has also recently published At the Heart of Christian Worship: Liturgical Essays of Yves Congar and Congar&#39;s classic work True and False Reform in the Church.Congar&#x2019;s writings remain salutary antidotes to the creeping gap between liturgy and life that threatens each parish today. This book of essays would be appropriate for parish and diocesan groups seeking to link their own ministry to the liturgical life of the Church.Church Life<br><br>An exceptional tool for current efforts to understand the conciliar documents accurately. One does not need a scholarly bent to grasp the ideas presented.Pastoral Music<br><br>We are great to Paul Philibert for this jewel of an introduction to Congar&#x2019;s liturgical theology, so readable that this writer kept forgetting it was a translation. If you want to recapture the ecclesiological vision of Vatican II that reshaped Roman Catholic worship, read this book.Edward Foley, New Theology Review<br><br>The mention of Yves Congar&#x2019;s name does not immediately bring to mind liturgy. Yet, these essays translated from French originals is another reminder of the breadth of this theologian&#x2019;s research that has had far-reaching significance for ecclesiology, pneumatology, patristics, sacramental theology, the role of the laity, the nature of reform, ecumenism and much else besides. These essays remind one to include liturgy or at least liturgical theology.Catholic Studies<br><br>For the liturgical scholar, these essays provide a critical apparatus and wealth of resources that cluster around the time-tried themes of liturgical participation and the relationship of liturgy and life. Something for everyone&#x2014;that&#x2019;s exactly what liturgy does. That&#x2019;s exactly what Paul Philibert has given us in this fine volume.Liturgical Ministry<br><br>Philibert&#x2019;s &#x2018;translator&#x2019;s observation&#x2019; is right on: Congar&#x2019;s challenges &#x2018;are as fresh today as they were sixty years ago&#x2019; (1) That is as true for this small volume of five essays&#x2014;as it might be of the more than 1700 entries listed in his prolific personal bibliography!Worship<br><br>The essays translated here are a treasure trove of theological reflection linking liturgy to ecclesiology. They are as fresh today as they were when Congar first wrote them. We are in Paul Philibert&#x2019;s debt.John F. Baldovin, SJ Professor of Historical &amp; Liturgical Theology Boston College School of Theology and Ministry<br><br>What a gift to the Church by translator and editor, Paul Philibert, as he makes these essays of Yves Congar available in English! The essays gathered here, although written decades ago, are totally applicable today as the Church continues to grapple with a key principle of the Second Vatican Council&#x2019;s teaching that the whole local community of faith is the subject or agent of worship. Philibert gives us both accurate and readable translations of Congar&#x2019;s French while also providing us with sound hermeneutical principles of interpretation in his brilliant Introduction and Conclusion sections.

Evident in this new edition is how New Wave has been cross-fertilized by reggae, rap, hardcore, and other nonmainstream styles. The third edition reviews 3000 albums of innovative, political, witty, and often offensive music--music like that of the group Polkacide, described as "accordians, horns, yelps, and general lunacy." The reviews are refreshingly blunt and insightful, without claiming more for the music than it merits, and the simple alphabetical arrangement and cross-referencing works well. The one drawback is that the book no longer includes both the U.S. and U.K. labels when both exist, but it may list a U.S. label with a U.K. release date.

In an era when Britain was the workshop of the world, design protection (nowadays patenting) was all the rage, and the apparently lenient approval process meant that all manner of bizarre curiosities were painstakingly recorded, in beautiful color illustrations and well-penned explanatory text, alongside the genuinely great inventions of the period.

When he asks her to marry him, she asks for time to adjust to their changed relationship.<br> <br>And then there's Priam Welby, who has been relentlessly pursuing Abrianna. Will his underhanded tactics succeed in luring Abrianna into marriage with him?</p><p>Abrianna shook her head. "I believe God has some very important work for me to do. At this point I'm not sure it can be accomplished in marriage."<br><br>Welby's expression grew quizzical. "So you are thinking of remaining single? Are you planning to end your engagement?"<br><br>"I'm trying my best to leave all of my plans in God's hands." She hadn't meant to give him the impression that she might not marry Wade, but concern about it was ever uppermost in her mind these last few days.<br><br>"Abrianna," he said in a hushed voice, "you know how I feel about your work for God. I would never dream of interfering and would, in fact, be most beneficial. I would still help you to rebuild a new facility for the needy, and you would see just how much it could help all those people you care so much about."<br><br>Glancing across the sanctuary, Abrianna shook her head. "Mr. Welby, I appreciate your thoughts and your support of my calling." She paused and gave him a smile. "But..."

Poussaint, M.D.</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p><b>Bill Cosby </b>is an author, actor, writer, and one of the most recognizable names in the field of entertainment.Here are two books by popular contemporary figures that deal with similar subject matter but take vastly different approaches. From a father's perspective and with his unique sense of humor, Cosby discusses the decision to have a child, the changes the child brings about, and the issues of discipline and independence. By making parents laugh at the pitfalls of parenthood, he shows them in his fresh and funny way that even at their moments of greatest frustration they are not alone. Harvard psychiatrist Poussaint's introduction and lengthy afterword, in which he discusses the changing role of the modern father, add greatly to the book's value as a parenting guide. By using actual letters children have written to her and weaving them together with personal anecdotes, Blume allows children to express their innermost feelings. She is thereby able to reveal children's fears about growing up, popularity, sexuality, and death and their experiences with such serious problems as drug abuse, incest, and life in foster care. While her book will give guidance to parents trying to understand their children (there is a list of agencies, as well), it will also appeal to young adults trying to understand themselves. Although neither book gives in-depth treatment to any topic, both are sure to have wide readership. Recommended for public libraries. Florence Scarinci, Nassau Community Coll.

He cannot know that nearby, events are unfolding that will change his life forever - events that were set in motion by a Vodou curse gone wrong, forty years before he was born. In the humble home of Sicilian immigrants, a one-year-old boy has been possessed by a demon. His father dead, lynched by a mob, his distraught mother at her wits&#39; end, this baby who yesterday could only crawl and gurgle is now walking, dancing, and talking - in a voice impossibly deep. The doctor has fled, and several men of the cloth have come and gone, including Typhus&#39; father, warned off directly by the clear voice of his Savoir. A newspaper man, shamed by the part he played in inciting the lynch mob that cost this boy his father, appalled by what he sees, goes in search of help. Seven will be persuaded, will try to help...and all seven will be profoundly affected by what takes place in that one-room house that dark night. Not all will leave alive, and all will be irrevocably changed by this demonic struggle, and by the sound of the first notes blown of a new musical form: jazz.</p><p>Louis Maistros is a longtime resident of the New Orleans 8th Ward neighborhood. Along with his wife Elly, he owns and operates Louie&#39;s Juke Joint, a combination jazz record shop and Vodou botanica. Maistros is a former forklift operator and a self-taught writer. His work has appeared in the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the Baltimore City Paper. He is mildly self-conscious about the fact that he shares a birthday with Lee Harvey Oswald, and is currently working out a conspiracy theory about that.Louis Maistros has written a lyrical, complex, and brave novel that takes enormous risks and pulls them all off. He is a writer to watch and keep reading, a writer to cherish. --<strong>Peter Straub</strong><br><br>One has to write with considerable authenticity to pull off a story steeped in magic and swamp water that examines race and class, death and rebirth, Haitian voodoo, and the beginnings of jazz in 1891 New Orleans. Maistros's gritty debut novel follows the interconnected lives of the Morningstar siblings--all lovingly named by their father after disease-- as they wrestle with a powerful demon, con outsiders, kill and die, die and are reborn. The plot is complex and magical, grounded in the history of the city, without being overly sentimental. There is a comfort with death as a part of life in this work that reveals deep feeling for the city and its past. Of course, every novel about New Orleans must have a good hurricane. Like the one in Zora Neale Hurston's classic Their Eyes Were Watching God, this hurricane destroys the city while making hope possible. Highly recommended for all fiction collections, especially where there is an interest in jazz. --<strong>Library Journal</strong><br><br>The Society of North American Magic Realists welcomes its newest, most dazzling member, Louis Maistros. His debut novel is a thing of wonder, unlike anything in our literature. It startles. It stuns. It stupefies. No novel since Confederacy of Dunces has done such justice to New Orleans. If Franz Kafka had been able to write like Peter Straub, this might have been the result. --<strong>Donald Harrington, Winner of the Robert Penn Warren Award and the Oxford-American Lifetime Achievement Award</strong></p><h2>Pinocchio</h2><p>Once there was a lonely woodcutter named Geppetto-who dreamed of having a boy of his own.

No, children you are wrong. There was once upon a time a piece of wood.This wood was not valuable: it was only a common log like those that are burnt in winter in the stoves and fireplaces to make a cheerful blaze and warm the rooms.I cannot say how it came about, but the fact is that one fine day this piece of wood was lying in the shop of an old carpenter of the name of Master Antonio. He was, however, called by everybody Master Cherry, on account of the end of his nose, which was always as red and polished as a ripe cherry.No sooner had Master Cherry set eyes on the piece of wood than his face beamed with delight; and, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction, he said softly to himself:"This wood has come to the right moment; it will just do to make the leg of a little table."Having said this he immediately took a sharp ax withwhich to remove the bark and the rough surface. Just, however, as he was going to give the first stroke, he remained with his arm suspended in the air, for he heard a very small voice saying imploringly, "Do not strike me so hard!"Picture to yourselves the astonishment of good old Master Cherry!He turned his terrified eyes all round the room to try and discover where the little voice could possibly have come from, but he saw nobody! He looked under the bench--nobody; he looked into a cupboard that was always shut--nobody; he looked into a basket of shavings and sawdust--nobody; he even opened the door of the shop and gave a glance into the street--and still nobody. Who, then, could it be?"I see how it is," he said, laughing and scratching his wig. "Evidently that little voice was all my imagination: Let us set to work again."And taking up the ax he struck a tremendous blow on the piece of wood."Oh! Oh! You have hurt me!" cried the same little voice dolefully.This time Master Cherry was petrified. His eyes started out of his head with fright, his mouth remained open, and his tongue hung out almost to the end of his chin, like a mask on a fountain. As soon as he had recovered the use of his speech, he began to say, stuttering and trembling with fear:"But where on earth can that little voice have come from that said Oh! Oh!? Here there is certainly no living soul. Is it possible that this piece of wood can have learnt to cry and to lament like a child? I cannot believe it. This piece of wood, here it is; a log for fuel like all the others, and thrown on the fire it would about suffice to boil a saucepan of beans ... . How then? Can anyone be hidden inside it? If anyone is hidden inside, so much the worse for him. I will settle him at once."So saying, he seized the poor piece of wood and commencedbeating it without mercy against the walls of the room.Then he stopped to listen if he could hear any little voice lamenting. He waited two minutes--nothing; five minutes--nothing; ten minutes--stilt nothing!"I see how it is," he then said, forcing himself to laugh and pushing up his wig. "Evidently the little voice that said Oh! Oh! was all my imagination! Let us set to work again."Nevertheless, he was very frightened, so he tried to sing to give himself a little courage.Putting the ax aside he took his plane, to plane and polish the bit of wood; but while he was running it up and down he heard the same little voice say laughing:"Have done! You are tickling me all over!"This time poor Master Cherry fell down as if he had been struck by lightning. When he at last opened his eyes he found himself seated on the floor.His face was quite changed, even the end of his nose, instead of being crimson, as it was nearly always, had become blue from fright.All new material in this edition copyright � 1996 by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.</p><h2>Misty: Digging Deep in Volleyball and Life</h2><p>The Olympic Gold Medal-winning volleyball player discusses growing up with her Olympian father, how alcoholism plagued her home, and her mother&#39;s untimely death from cancer, and tells behind-the-scenes stories from her rise to volleyball stardom.</p><p><b>Misty May-Treanor</b> was born in Los Angeles and grew up playing beach volleyball at the Santa Monica Pier with her father, Butch, a 1968 Olympian, and her mother Barbara. She graduated from Long Beach State, where she was a vital member of the 1998 NCAA Championship team and received the Honda-Broderick Award for the nation&#x2019;s collegiate female athlete of the year. After a brief stint with the U.S. national indoor team, she went on to revolutionize the sport of beach volleyball, becoming the best women&#x2019;s player ever. Misty currently splits time between California and Florida with her husband, Majoy League Baseball catcher Matt Treanor.<br><br><b>Jill Lieber Steeg</b> has been an award-winning senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>USA TODAY</i>. In her more than three decades in journalism, she has established herself as one of the nation&#x2019;s preeminent profile writers and investigative sports reporters. She lives in California with her husband Jim and their beloved golden retreiver Fenway.The case can be made that Misty May-Treanor is the most accomplished female athlete of her generation: two state volleyball championships in high school, an NCAA championship in college, domination of women&#39;s professional beach volleyball, and two Olympic gold medals. She was the child of two world-class athletes and came to embody their competitiveness and discipline. Much of her autobiography reads like Sports Bio 101: descriptions of important competitions, training routines, wins, losses, and rehabbing from injuries. Still, coauthor Steeg, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, keeps the narrative flowing and injects enough humor to maintain interest. When May-Treanor steps away from sports, she recounts difficult episodes in her personal lilfe, such as her father&#39;s alcoholism and her mother&#39;s 2002 death from cancer. The account of her mother&#39;s long illness and the void left by her death is touchingly honest and a reminder that success does not immunize one against life&#39;s most painful moments. Certainly of general interest to sports fans and especially valuable and inspirational to young female athletes. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Bedtime Is Canceled</h2><p><p>The note read: <i>Bedtime is canceled</i>.

His paintings during the teens in Paris, where he moved in 1911, caused such a stir that such important figures as Picasso and Paul Eluard immediately praised them. This phase of his work, which he later termed pittura metafisica (metaphysical painting) was marked by dramatic compositions involving sharp perspective, striking shadows, geometrical planes, voids of space, and a general feeling of anxiety and loneliness; the sense of absurdity evoked by the mannequin-like figures in almost nightmarish landscapes seemed to suggest a Freudian expression of the unconscious. After 1930, De Chirico turned to a more classical style of painting and continued in the same vein for the rest of his career; his later work was widely criticized, especially by the Surrealists who had so admired his early paintings.</p><p>Magdalena Holzhey studied art history, Italian, and musicology in Berlin and Pisa.

The colorful spot art and full-pageillustrations serve primarily as attractive background. Both art and text are inadequate in providing clear insights; they do not give students a true portrayal of the science involved even in a general way. The most serious problems are with the text, which is imprecise in word choice and information, resulting in misconceptions. For example, "native" is defined in the glossary as "animals or plants that live in a specific place," which is only partially true as plants may inhabit a specific place even though they're not native. In addition, there is no documentation.

Not only was it the largest battle between the Indian and U.S. Army, it was the only time the army was forced to withdraw. Why withdraw?

In About Looking he explores our role as observers to reveal new layers of meaning in what we see. How do the animals we look at in zoos remind us of a relationship between man and beast all but lost in the twentieth century? What is it about looking at war photographs that doubles their already potent violence? How do the nudes of Rodin betray the threats to his authority and potency posed by clay and flesh? And how does solitude inform the art of Giacometti? In asking these and other questions, Berger quietly -- but fundamentally -- alters the vision of anyone who reads his work.</p><p>In About Looking the author explores our role as observers to reveal new layers of meaning in what we see.

This collection of his stories &#x2014;astonishingly, the first ever to appear in English&#x2014;shows him to have been a master of short fiction too.<br><br> <i>Bright Magic</i> includes all of D�blin&#x2019;s first book, <i>The Murder of a Buttercup</i>, a work of savage brilliance and a landmark of literary expressionism, as well as two longer stories composed in the 1940s, when he lived in exile in Southern California. The early collection is full of mind-bending and sexually charged narratives, from the dizzying descent into madness that has made the title story one of the most anthologized of German stories to &#x201c;She Who Helped,&#x201d; where mortality roams the streets of nineteenth-�century Manhattan with a white borzoi and a quiet smile, and &#x201c;The Ballerina and the Body,&#x201d; which describes a terrible duel to the death. Of the two later stories, &#x201c;Materialism, A Fable,&#x201d; in which news of humanity&#x2019;s soulless doctrines reaches the animals, elements, and the molecules themselves, is especially delightful.</p><p><b>Alfred D�blin</b>&nbsp;(1878&#x2013;1957) was born in German Stettin (now the Polish city of Szczecin), to Jewish parents. When he was ten his father, a master tailor, eloped with a seamstress, abandoning the family. Subsequently his mother relocated the rest of the family to Berlin. D�blin studied medicine at Friedrich Wilhelm University, specializing in neurology and psychiatry. While working at a psychiatric clinic in Berlin, he became romantically entangled with two women: Friede Kunke, with whom he had a son, Bodo, in 1911, and Erna Reiss, to whom he had become engaged before learning of Kunke&#x2019;s pregnancy. He married Erna the next year, and they remained together for the rest of his life. His novel<i>&nbsp;The Three Leaps of Wang Lun</i>&nbsp;was published in 1915 while D�blin was serving as a military doctor; it went on to win the Fontane Prize. In 1920 he published&nbsp;<i>Wallenstein</i>, a novel set during the Thirty Years&#x2019; War that was an oblique comment on the First World War. He became president of the Association of German Writers in 1924, and published his best-known novel,&nbsp;<i>Berlin �Alexanderplatz</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>in 1929, achieving modest mainstream fame while solidifying his position at the center of an intellectual group that included Bertolt Brecht, Robert Musil, and Joseph Roth, among others. He fled Germany with his family soon after Hitler&#x2019;s rise, moving first to Zurich, then to Paris, and, after the Nazi invasion of France, to Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism and briefly worked as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After the war he returned to Germany and worked as an editor with the aim of rehabilitating literature that had been banned under Hitler, but he found himself at odds with conservative postwar cultural trends. He suffered from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease in later years and died in Emmendingen in 1957.

He and his wife live in Maine and the Florida Keys.Grade 4-7?Young orphaned Roy and his arsonist adult brother, Joe Dilly, are heading West, fleeing an earlier arson scene and looking for work on a horse ranch. At the Bar None, they find a place where they can avoid the law and earn their keep. Roy can also earn a pony, if he can break her. Lady is a beautiful, wild palomino that has already stolen his heart, but even if she lets him ride her, he worries that Joe Dilly's uncontrollable emotions and fascination with fire will destroy all of his hopes and force them to move on yet again. Philbrick discloses just the right amount of detail about Joe Dilly's fires to create concern for young Roy and draw readers into the story. Roy's first-person description blends smoothly into authentic dialogue with a Western accent. The characters are fully developed, showing both strengths and weaknesses. However, the "horse whisperer" effect Joe Dilly has on totally unmanageable horses is a bit far-fetched. Some of the horses' behaviors are equally unrealistic, as when Joe Dilly rides a crazy stallion bareback through the side of a burning barn. But the story on the whole has plenty of action and suspense and is a good choice for encouraging reluctant readers.?Christina Linz, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction</h2><p><b>Makes a powerful argument for adopting a model of restorative justice as part of the Innocence Movement so exonerees, crime victims, and their communities can come together to heal.</b><br><br>In <i>Rectify</i>, a former Innocence Project director and journalist Lara Bazelon puts a face to the growing number of men and women exonerated from crimes that kept them behind bars for years&#x2014;sometimes decades&#x2014;and that devastate not only the exonerees but also their families, the crime victims who mistakenly identified them as perpetrators, the jurors who convicted them, and the prosecutors who realized too late that they helped convict an innocent person.<br><br>Bazelon focuses on Thomas Haynesworth, a teenager arrested for multiple rapes in Virginia, and Janet Burke, a rape victim who mistakenly IDed him. It took over two decades before he was exonerated. Conventional wisdom points to an exoneration as a happy ending to tragic tales of injustice, such as Haynesworth&#x2019;s. However, even when the physical shackles are left behind, invisible ones can be profoundly more difficult to unlock.<br><br>In the midst of Bazelon&#x2019;s frustration over the blatant limitations of courts and advocates, her hope is renewed by the fledgling but growing movement to apply the centuries-old practice of restorative justice to wrongful conviction cases. Using the stories of Thomas Haynesworth, Janet Burke, and other crime victims and exonerees, she demonstrates how the transformative experience of connecting isolated individuals around mutual trauma and a shared purpose of repairing harm unite unlikely allies. Movingly written and vigorously researched, <i>Rectify</i> takes to task the far-reaching failures of our criminal justice system and offers a window into a future where the power it yields can be used in pursuit of healing and unity rather than punishment and blame.</p><p><b>Lara Bazelon</b> is a writer and associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law, where she is the director of the Criminal Juvenile Justice and Racial Justice Clinics. A 2016 MacDowell Fellow and a 2017 Mesa Refuge Langeloth Fellow, she is the former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent. Bazelon is also a nonresident fellow with Brandeis University&#x2019;s Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism. Her writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Atlantic,</i> <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Politico,</i> and <i>Slate,</i> where she is a contributing writer and has a long-running series about wrongful conviction cases. This is her first book.&#x201c;Lara Bazelon&#x2019;s groundbreaking book <i>Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction</i> is a searing indictment of the criminal justice system&#x2019;s penchant for flawed practices, depraved indifference toward offenders and wanton abuses of power.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Juvenile Justice Information Exchange</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Rectify</i> takes perhaps the first fair and balanced look at the unique and devastating harm that wrongful convictions inflict. From the original victims and the innocent men and women to our families and wider communities, Lara Bazelon&#x2019;s groundbreaking work demonstrates that by collectively showing up and bearing witness to each other&#x2019;s trauma, we can unpack our grief, restore our voices, and become strong and powerful wounded healers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jennifer Thompson, coauthor of <i>Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption</i> and founder of Healing Justice<br><br>&#x201c;Lara Bazelon is a personal hero of mine. She fearlessly tackles treacherous legal issues with her brain and her pen, and the results are profound. In <i>Rectify</i>, she shines a light on the &#x2018;second punishment&#x2019; that follows exoneration: the stigmas and obstacles that former prisoners and crime victims face even though they&#x2019;ve already paid a terrible price. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jason Flom, CEO of Lava Records and host of <i>Wrongful Conviction with Jason Flom</i><br><br>&#x201c;Almost always, discussions of restorative justice consider only its role in mending the lives of victims, offenders, and the community when guilt is clear and accepted. But, to paraphrase a senior legislator this vital book quotes, in courts it is not only justice that we do; it is injustice too. Now Lara Bazelon focuses her remarkable ability to tell stories on that overlooked rip in the fabric: the cases in which the convict is innocent, in which the person in prison is not the offender at all. As she shows movingly and simply, the principles of restorative justice have an invaluable role in mending there too. Starting today, no examination of restorative justice will be adequate without considering what Lara Bazelon has added with <i>Rectify</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dean Strang, defense lawyer in <i>State of Wisconsin v. Steven Avery</i> and author of <i>Worse Than the Devil</i><br><br>&#x201c;The innocence movement transformed the way we think about the criminal justice system by exonerating thousands of wrongfully convicted men and women. <i>Rectify</i> asks what healing looks like, for them and for the crime victims whose lives have been upended. It is a story about restorative justice that is by turns tragic, inspiring, and triumphant.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Barry Scheck, cofounder and director of the Innocence Project</p><h2>In the Garden of Iden (A Novel of the Company, Book 1)</h2><p>In the 24th century, the Company preserves works of art and extinct forms of life. It recruits orphans from the past, renders them all but immortal, and trains them to serve the Company. Mendoza is sent to Elizabethan England to collect samples from the garden of Sir Walter Iden. Her quest is jeopardized by Nicholas Harpole, who stirs unfamiliar emotions within her about her future--with a man she will long outlive.</p><p>In 16th-century Spain, everybody expects the Spanish Inquisition, as they have a well-known tendency to cart people off to their dungeons on trumped-up charges. What 5-year-old Mendoza, on the brink of being tortured as a Jew, is totally unprepared for is to be rescued by the Company--the ultimate bureaucracy of the 24th century--and made immortal. In return, all she has to do is travel through time on a series of assignments for the Company and collect endangered botanical specimens. The wisecracking, mildly misanthropic Mendoza wants nothing to do with historical humans, but her first assignment is to travel to England in 1553--uncomfortably close to those damn Inquisitors--with Joseph and Nefer, two other Company operatives. Their intent is to gather herb samples from the garden of Sir Walter Iden, a foolish though generous country squire. (Kage Baker knows her Shakespeare: Sir Walter is the descendant of Alexander Iden, loyal subject of Henry IV, who slew the hungry rebel Jack Cade in that very garden in Kent.) <p> The cyborg trio poses as Doctor Ruy Lopez, his daughter Rosa (the irrepressible Mendoza, now grown), and her duenna, Do�a Marguerita; Sir Walter's hospitality and discretion are bought for the promise of restored youth. (There are hilarious moments that call to mind the Coneheads, who claimed to be from France when caught doing anything peculiar.) Sir Walter's secretary, Nicholas Harpole, is immediately suspicious of and hostile towards the strange "Spanish" visitors, which prompts Mendoza to fall in love with him. Nicholas has his own badly kept secret: he's proudly Protestant at a time when Queen Mary and Philip of Spain are on a Catholicizing rampage. Mendoza knows Nicholas is probably doomed, and that as a Company operative she cannot meddle with his fate, but love makes people do desperate things. Baker surpasses even Connie Willis in humor and precision of period detail in this fresh, ingenious first novel.<i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p><p>Born in Hollywood, Kage Baker has been an artist, actor, and director at the Living History Centre, and has taught Elizabethan English as a Second Language. <em>Sky Coyote</em> is her second novel.

Or do we? These stereotypes of the popular imagination are precisely that - imaginary - created by amateur biographers from Mrs Gaskell onwards who were primarily novelists, and were attracted by the tale of an apparently doomed family of genius. Later biographers still repeat her mistakes, and have, without exception, relied on the bowdlerised texts published by T.J. Wise, a forger. Juliet Barker&#39;s landmark book is the first definitive history of the Brontes. It demolishes the myths, yet provides startling new information that is just as compelling - but true. Based on firsthand research among all the Bronte manuscripts, many so tiny they can only be read by magnifying glass, and among contemporary historical documents never before used by Bronte biographers, this book is both scholarly and compulsively readable.</p><p>Juliet Barker has a D.Phil in history from Oxford University, and was for six years librarian/curator of the Bronte Parsonage Museum at Haworth. She has been involved with all recent research into the Brontes, and has made many major new finds which are revealed for the first time in this book.Neither Charlotte, Emily, Anne, nor Branwell Brontelived past the age of 38, yet they left an impression on English literature that has fully occupied biographers, many of whom have portrayed the Brontes as doomed romantics, held captive for all of their adult years by a cruel, widowed curate father in the wasteland of the Yorkshire moors. But Barker, a past curator of the BronteParsonage Museum, tells a different tale with admirable objectivity; her extensively documented alternative view is based on new material, including family letters. Convincingly, she portrays Haworth, the town where the Brontes passed their lives, not as the traditional barrens, but as a fairly active agricultural and mercantile locale, subject to clerical, political, and economic struggles. (Her accounts of bad sanitary conditions and rife disease are especially compelling.) Patrick Bronte, in her perspective, emerges as an impressively rational and steadfastly affectionate father, not the egregiously high-minded belligerent of lore. As for the four siblings, Barker takes care not to presume or sentimentalize. She methodically outlines Branwell's notorious decline into drug and alcohol addiction, suggesting its consequences for other family members; offers Anne, the least appreciated of the writers, as, in some respects, the most adventurous in her pursuit of realism; and considers Charlotte critically yet sympathetically as an imperious, often manipulative literary majordomo whose unrequited love for her Belgian language teacher ran parallel in its self-destructive energy to her brother's dangerous liaison with an opportunistic married woman. Despite the book's saturation in period detail, the cumulative effect of Barker's 800-odd pages is oddly contemporary: a legendary literary quartet steps out of the storybooks with a distinctly welcome, unemotional clarity. <i>Molly McQuade</i></p><h2>The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty</h2><p>Rice writing as A. N. Roquelaure. <br> <br>In the traditional folk tale "Sleeping Beauty," the spell cast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle can only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. Anne Rice's retelling of the Beauty story probes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive tale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual desire.</p><p><b>PREFACE</b> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and found something erotic at its core. The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy. So many clich�s have been broken and abandoned.

With him is a small Hungry Thing wearing a sign that says " Me Too." They cause quite a stir on the school playground, and their requests for unusual foods such as flamburgers, bellyjeans, and blownuts cause confusion and some zany guesses from the teachers. Luckily, the children are able to rhyme their way to the true translations. When it's time for them to leave, the small Thing begins to cry, until the children come up with a way to appease her. The playful rhymes and the friendly but gluttonous beasts make this an appealing book. Children will enjoy the grown-ups' ridiculous guesses as well as the absurd pictures that accompany them. The cartoon illustrations, done in soft dreamlike colors, are not remarkable but adequate: the adults in their long flowing robes and towering hats are rather frightening, and the children have a blank-eyed Orphan Annie look. The imaginary beasts, however, are delightful, and the Hungry Thing is sure to win some new fans.

In 1946 he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. His best-known works include Steppenwolf, Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game , each of which explores an individual&#39;s search for authenticity, self-knowledge and spirituality In 1895 he began working in the bookshop in T�bingen which had a specialized collection in theology, philology and law. After the end of each day He pursued his own work further spending his Sundays with books. He studied theological writings, Goethe, Lessing, Schiller and Greek mythology. In 1896, his poem &#34;Madonna&#34; appeared in a Viennese periodical. By 1898, He had a respectable income that enabled financial independence. He concentrated on the German Romantics, including Brentano, Freiherr von Eichendorff, H�lderlin and Novalis. He released his first small volume of poetry, Romantic Songs, and a collection of prose entitled One Hour After Midnight. Both works were a business failure. In two years, only 54 of the 600 printed copies of Romantic Songs were sold, and One Hour After Midnight received only one printing and sold sluggishly. Nevertheless, the Leipzig publisher Eugen Diederichs was convinced of the literary quality of the work and, from the beginning, regarded the publications more as encouragement of a young author than as profitable business. From the autumn of 1899, Hesse worked in a distinguished antique book shop in Basel. Through family contacts, he stayed with the intellectual families of Basel. In this environment with rich stimuli for his pursuits, he further developed spiritually and artistically. At the same time, Basel offered the solitary Hesse many opportunities for withdrawal into a private life of artistic self-exploration, journeys and wanderings.

Told by nine-and-a-half-year-old Tommy Stubbins, crewman and future naturalist, the voyages of Doctor Dolittle and his company lead them to Spidermonkey Island. Along with his faithful friends, Polynesia the parrot and Chee-Chee the monkey, Doctor Dolittle survives a perilous shipwreck and lands on the mysterious floating island. There he meets the wondrous Great Glass See Snail who holds the key to the greates mystery of all.Hugh Lofting (1886-1947) began what became the Doctor Dolittle stories while writing letters to his children from the front during World War I. <i>The Story of Doctor Dolittle,</i> first published in 1920, was followed by <i>The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle</i>, which was awarded the Newbery Medal, and ten more popular books in the series.<p></p></p><h2>Wealth and Power: China&#39;s Long March to the Twenty-first Century</h2><p>Through a series of lively and absorbing portraits of iconic modern Chinese leaders and thinkers, two of today&#x2019;s foremost specialists on China provide a panoramic narrative of this country&#x2019;s rise to preeminence that is at once analytical and personal. How did a nation, after a long and painful period of dynastic decline, intellectual upheaval, foreign occupation, civil war,&nbsp;and&nbsp;revolution,&nbsp;manage to burst forth onto the world stage with such an impressive run of hyperdevelopment and wealth creation&#x2014;culminating in the extraordinary dynamism of China today?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Wealth and Power</i> answers this question by examining the lives of eleven influential officials, writers, activists, and leaders whose contributions helped create modern China. This fascinating survey begins in the lead-up to the first Opium War with Wei Yuan, the nineteenth-century scholar and reformer who was one of the first to urge China to borrow ideas from the West. It concludes in our time with human-rights advocate and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, an outspoken opponent of single-party rule. Along the way, we meet such titans of Chinese history as the Empress Dowager Cixi, public intellectuals Feng Guifen, Liang Qichao, and Chen Duxiu, Nationalist stalwarts Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, and Communist Party leaders Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhu Rongji.<br> &nbsp;<br> The common goal that unites all of these disparate figures is their determined pursuit of <i>fuqiang,</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;wealth and power.&#x201d; This abiding quest for a restoration of national greatness in the face of a &#x201c;century of humiliation&#x201d; at the hands of the Great Powers came to define the modern Chinese character. It&#x2019;s what drove both Mao and Deng to embark on root-and-branch transformations of Chinese society, first by means of Marxism-Leninism, then by authoritarian capitalism. And this determined quest remains the key to understanding many of China&#x2019;s actions today.<br> &nbsp;<br> By unwrapping the intellectual antecedents of today&#x2019;s resurgent China, Orville Schell and John Delury supply much-needed insight into the country&#x2019;s tortured progression from nineteenth-century decline to twenty-first-century boom. By looking backward into the past to understand forces at work for hundreds of years, they help us understand China today and the future that this singular country is helping shape for all of us.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>ST.

Published serially in a popular journal, it was a strange blend of patriotic reverie and science fiction conjuring up what a rejuvenated China might look like sixty years hence&#x2014;after it had reemerged as a strong, prosperous, and respected country once again. Although Liang, the most influential public intellectual of his generation, completed only a few chapters, his fictional exercise allowed his many readers, distraught by the Qing Dynasty&#x2019;s inability to adapt to modern times, to dream a little about what their benighted country might be like in an idealized future, circa 1962. As he imagined it then, the world&#x2019;s leading scholars, statesmen, and merchants would all clamor to visit and pay tribute both to China&#x2019;s modern present and its Confucian past at an international exposition to be held in Shanghai&#x2014;strangely like the World Expo the city actually did hold in 2010. &#x201c;I truly believe that this type of book can be a great help to China&#x2019;s future,&#x201d; Liang wrote.<br><br>The Future of New China was not exactly great literature, and Liang admitted as much, commenting self-deprecatingly that the work-in-progress made him &#x201c;laugh at myself.&#x201d; But reading the novel&#x2019;s chapters today, when China is, in fact, ever more wealthy, powerful, and respected, imbues that long-ago moment with a triste sense of just how passionately Chinese then yearned to escape the bitter reality of their country&#x2019;s humiliating decline, even if only by projecting themselves for a moment into an imaginary future.<br><br>Such fantasies were an all too understandable antidote to China&#x2019;s century-long decline, and Liang was not the last to indulge in dreaming of remote triumphs. Four decades later, another well-known writer, Lin Yutang, contemplating a China largely occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army and steeped in even deeper misery, experienced a similar wishful prefiguration of the future. In his 1942 book Between Tears and Laughter, Lin described being visited by an &#x201c;intuition,&#x201d; almost &#x201c;mystic&#x201d; in nature, which &#x201c;blew like a whiff of clean air through the tortuous maze in which my will and my mind were imprisoned and paralyzed.&#x201d; He wrote defiantly how, even with backwardness and despair everywhere around him, he nonetheless &#x201c;saw China growing strong.&#x201d; &#x201c;I know that this nation of 450,000,000 people, united and awakened and purged by the war-fire, is coming up,&#x201d; he insisted against all evidence. &#x201c;The strength lies in her and nothing the western nations can do can stop her or keep her down.&#x201d;<br><br>Such improbable dreams of a wealthy, strong, and proud China gave expression to widespread but frustrated yearnings for a revival of national greatness that arose in the nineteenth century, when for the first time in centuries Chinese could no longer think automatically and indisputably of their empire as Zhongguo (&#x4e2d;&#x56fd;), the &#x201c;Central Kingdom.&#x201d; Today, however, after three decades of dynamic economic growth on a scale and speed beyond anything the modern world has ever known, the fantasies of Liang Qichao and Lin Yutang seem prophetic.<br><br>Such a starkly unexpected ending to modern China&#x2019;s torturous developmental story compels us to reexamine the narrative of endless modernization failure with which we have all grown up. How did China&#x2019;s modern history of relentless humiliation and backwardness, of failed reform and disastrous revolution&#x2014;the curse of generation after generation of would-be activists trying to create a &#x201c;new China&#x201d;&#x2014;suddenly morph into such a story of triumph? Was it really just a sudden post-Mao miracle conjured up by Deng Xiaoping, or were the seeds of the present planted long ago, only germinating so slowly that at the time it was difficult to see, or even imagine the shape of things to come . . . except in a few fictional dreamscapes? <br><br>This is not another book heralding or bemoaning China&#x2019;s rise. Instead, we have chosen to engage in what is more of a historical reflection on the backstory to China&#x2019;s &#x201c;economic miracle,&#x201d; an attempt to use history to find a new vantage point on its progress, emphasizing the perspectives of the Chinese themselves. In short, our goal has been to embark on a somewhat different kind of explanation for how, after over a century of decline, occupation, civil war, state repression, and socialist revolution, China finally did manage to catapult itself into an era of stunning dynamism and economic growth. To do this, we have chosen to primarily rely not on new archival material, but instead on preexisting scholarship&#x2014;both the older classics in the field and some more recent research&#x2014;works in which both of us have been immersed over our many collective decades of studying China&#x2019;s history. By standing on the shoulders of this collective body of work we hope to see a bit further toward the horizon of China&#x2019;s future, so bound up as it is with China&#x2019;s past. For it is these works that shaped, and continue to shape, our own thinking and understanding. And since both of us have also had long personal odysseys studying, living, and working in China, we have also drawn on some of these more immediate experiences that have also played an important role in helping us make sense out of how and why things have worked out as they have in this most singular of countries.<br><br>In reading through historical accounts of the lives, writings, and speeches of the diverse group of iconic political and intellectual figures presented in this book, a common chord rings through all their work&#x2014;the abiding quest for fuqiang (&#x5bcc;&#x5f3a;), &#x201c;wealth and power.&#x201d; Our account of modern China is thus the story of how these national leaders marched their people down the long road to fuxing (&#x590d;&#x5174;), rejuvenation, and, by doing so, made Chinese society finally more ready than ever before for the possibility of a more open and democratic future.<br><br>The couplet of characters fuqiang has most commonly been translated as &#x201c;wealth and power,&#x201d; and as a result the term&#x2014;a shorthand version of the ancient adage fuguo qiangbing (&#x5bcc;&#x56fd;&#x5f3a;&#x5175;), &#x201c;enrich the state and strengthen its military power&#x201d;&#x2014;has thus worked its way into historical literature in the English language. The expression was coined during the Warring States Period more than two millennia ago, as when the Legalist philosopher Han Feizi explained bluntly, &#x201c;If a wise ruler masters wealth and power, he can have whatever he desires.&#x201d; For Chinese reformers since the early nineteenth century, these two characters have repeatedly stood in for the profound desire among China&#x2019;s cognoscenti to see their country restored to the kind of greatness their ancestors had once taken for granted. Above all, these patriotic Chinese yearned for their nation to be able to defend itself against foreign incursion. Although in classical times these two characters conveyed a certain sense of aggressiveness, when the phrase was revived in the nineteenth century in a context of an empire in decline and struggling to maintain its territorial integrity, the subtext of &#x201c;wealth and power&#x201d; was self-defense rather than foreign conquest. A more fitting translation might actually have been: &#x201c;prosperity and strength.&#x201d;<br><br>As China&#x2019;s humiliation deepened through each defeat by imperialist powers from the Opium War (1839&#x2013;42) onward, the scramble to find the keys to China&#x2019;s lost &#x201c;wealth and power&#x201d; gained an almost unbearable urgency. The ardor with which successive generations of Chinese intellectual and political leaders pursued fuqiang&#x2014;even though most of them ended up with very little to show for their efforts&#x2014;ultimately proved a unique dynamo fueling the country&#x2019;s constant and fervent pursuit of self-reinvention and rejuvenation.<br><br>The obverse of the elusive dream of &#x201c;wealth and power&#x201d; was, of course, China&#x2019;s chronic reality of poverty, weakness, and ignominy. As the West and Japan encroached ever more on its territorial sovereignty and as its people began to lose confidence in the superiority of their Confucian system itself, first uncertainty, and finally debilitating doubt and self-disparagement infected the entire society. When China was defeated by Japan&#x2014;a presumably inferior Asian power&#x2014;in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894&#x2013;95, the shock was staggering. By the end of World War I, the notion of their country as a global victim had become an organic part of how Chinese looked at themselves and their place in the world, with variations on the theme of &#x201c;humiliation&#x201d; infecting every aspect of China&#x2019;s cultural, psychological, and political being. Confronting this narrative of prey versus predators, in which they were inevitably bested, Chinese reformers and leaders wrestled with the complex task of blaming the predatory great powers, while at the same time somehow absolving their own countrymen of too crippling a sense of inferiority and hopelessness. Myriad new slogans arose, and many have endured to this day, all emanating from a crushing sense of China&#x2019;s having fallen from a previous state of grace: &#x201c;Restore the nation and erase the stain of humiliation!&#x201d; &#x201c;Endure humiliation to carry out our important task!&#x201d; By the 1940s, Chinese were speaking regularly of &#x201c;a century of humiliation&#x201d; and had even established a National Humiliation Day. To this day, children are still exhorted to &#x201c;never forget national humiliation and strengthen our national defense.&#x201d;<br><br>Modern Chinese intellectuals have continuously woven these grievances together into an ever more elaborate tapestry in which a weakened China is depicted as being unfairly pitted against a powerful, aggressive imperialist world. Within this frieze of history, our book examines how foreign exploitation and the ensuing humiliation that flowed from it became a deeply seductive, if painful, way of understanding their country&#x2019;s inescapable failures, how these failures also became organic parts of a new national identity (marked by what one scholar has described as the &#x201c;sanctification of victimhood&#x201d;), and finally how they paradoxically provided raw material for escaping the dilemma of perpetually being both stepped on and one step behind the great powers of the world. Foreign superiority may have been humiliating and shameful, but it also served as a sharp goad urging Chinese to sacrifice for all the various reform movements and revolutions that came to be launched as a way to remove the stigma of their shame. And nationalism, which reformers and revolutionaries alike turned to as a way to galvanize the populace against their ignominy, grew directly out of China&#x2019;s evolving consciousness of failure and weakness, its roots well irrigated by the aquifer of historical humiliation that had long been pooling beneath it.<br><br>In the nineteenth century, the effort to efface national humiliation and restore China to wealth, strength, and respect had been largely focused on the question of how the West&#x2019;s military technology and economic yong (&#x7528;), &#x201c;techniques,&#x201d; might be harnessed to China&#x2019;s own national ziqiang (&#x81ea;&#x5f3a;), &#x201c;self-strengthening&#x201d; effort. By the early twentieth century, however, the need for more far-reaching and radical approaches had become painfully apparent. It was in this period that Chinese thinkers first began seriously questioning the wisdom of maintaining the inner ti (&#x4f53;), or &#x201c;core,&#x201d; of the country&#x2019;s traditional culture, fearing that China&#x2019;s backwardness and inability to adapt to the modern world was rooted in Confucian values themselves. Fin de si�cle public intellectuals such as Liang Qichao and Yan Fu, for example, were ready to jettison the foundations of Chinese culture and import Western ideas in their place as part of a desperate effort to restore their country to greatness. &#x201c;We have no time to ask whether this knowledge is Chinese or Western, whether it is old or new,&#x201d; Yan wrote imploringly. &#x201c;If one course leads to ignorance and thus to poverty and weakness . . . we must cast it aside. If another course is effective in overcoming ignorance and thus leads to a cure of our poverty and weakness, we must imitate it, even if it proceeds from barbarians.&#x201d;<br><br>Soon thereafter, even more radical skeptics had launched a cultural and intellectual uprising known as the New Culture Movement, calling for a wholesale repudiation of China&#x2019;s past and a new regimen of even more extensive foreign borrowing. For these activists, around whom much of twentieth-century Chinese history turned, the demolition of the country&#x2019;s ancient Confucian escutcheon became part of a sacred mission to &#x201c;save the nation.&#x201d;<br><br>Unlike democratic political reform in the West, which developed out of a belief in certain universal values and human rights as derived from a &#x201c;natural,&#x201d; if not God-given, source, and so were to be espoused regardless of their efficacy, the dominant tradition of reform in China evolved from a far more utilitarian source. Its primary focus was to return China to a position of strength, and any way that might help achieve this goal was thus worth considering. What &#x201c;libert�, egalit�, fraternit�&#x201d; meant to the French Revolution and to the making of modernity in the West, &#x201c;wealth, strength, and honor&#x201d; have meant to the forging of modern China. As a result, Chinese reformers tended to inhabit what looks to Western eyes like a pragmatic kingdom of means, rather than an idealistic world of ends. Reformers have been interested in democratic governance at various stages in China&#x2019;s tortuous path, not so much because it might enshrine sacred, inalienable political liberties but because it might make their nation more dynamic and thus stronger. &#x201c;We cannot decide whether an idea is good or not without seeing it in practice&#x201d; was the way Sun Yat-sen, &#x201c;Father of the Nation,&#x201d; who helped bring republican government to China, once pragmatically observed. &#x201c;If the idea is of practical value to us and to the world, it is good. If the idea is impractical, it is no good.&#x201d;<br><br>By this logic, since the liberal political philosophies and governmental systems of the West had been so effective in creating such extraordinary national strength, would it not be foolish of Chinese reformers not to also experiment with them? But the same held true for communism, fascism, and authoritarianism. If one kind of &#x201c;borrowing&#x201d; did not do the job, the inclination was to try another, and another . . . until China could find a formula that worked. So in their relentless quest for wealth, strength, and finally greatness, successive generations of reformers bent their energies toward giving their country the equivalent of serial economic, intellectual, cultural, and political organ transplants.<br><br>Initially, conservative and sometimes xenophobic factions obstructed and inhibited this process, but over time, the scope of what might be acceptably imported from abroad kept growing. However, whatever means of borrowing were chosen, the goal was almost always the same: the &#x201c;salvation&#x201d; of the nation and its restoration to global preeminence. It was this pragmatic willingness to try anything that has given the drama of modern Chinese history its strangely disjointed quality, as if each succeeding act of borrowing had been imagined and written by a different playwright.<br><br>Alas, learning from foreign models turned out to have its own set of problems, for to borrow from elsewhere in such a wholesale way meant to deny the most organic aspect of being Chinese, namely, its own unique cultural tradition extending back thousands of years. Indeed, for more than a century and a half, the country found itself oscillating between attraction to and then repulsion from a culture that had for millennia served it well, yet now seemed the very cause of its weakness and failure.

Almost simultaneously, more than fifty other Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy by Islamist militants, an event that has recently captivated the world again with the success of the book and film&nbsp;<i>Argo</i>. With the hostage crisis receiving most of the attention from the media and White House, it was largely left to Copeland&#x2019;s mother and family to negotiate his father&#x2019;s reprieve from the firing squad. Now, more than thirty years later, Copeland sets out to find the truth about his father and his role in the Iranian hostage crisis.

I recognized my mother&#x2019;s cursive&#x2014;as well as her flair for drama. The story contained in this file had all the markings of a classical affair. Secret meetings. Unaccounted-for hours. Divided loyalties. For thirty years, the file had lain dormant at the bottom of this box&#x2014;which had followed us Copelands from Iran to Pennsylvania, through four suburban homes, to the dusty corner of the library where it now resided. In a strange way, I believe it was my father&#x2019;s will that I found the file. Last week, a land prospector called with news of mineral rights that once belonged to my dad. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re yours if you can prove ownership,&#x201d; she told my mother, who promptly dispatched me to the study to locate my father&#x2019;s will. I was buried deep in the wilderness of boxed diplomas, old address books, photos, tax files, and receipts, when from the bottom of a box of relics, the past coughed up a different nugget.</p><p>&#x201c;Open it,&#x201d; my mother said. Into our laps spilled several documents. The first was a newspaper clipping dated November 27, 1979.</p><p>Cia Agent Smuggling Radar Equipment Caught</p><p>November 27, 1979</p><p>TEHRAN&#x2014;The Revolutionary Guards here arrested a CIA agent who was trying to smuggle eight console radar machines to the United States. Max Copeland, whose nationality was not identified yet, had booked eight boxes of radar equipment belonging to the Iranian Air Force at Mehrabad customs destined for the United States&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>A succession of other documents fell from the file, their pages delicate and crisped by time. There was a formal rebuttal written by my father disputing the charges. An affidavit from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. A packing list. A long letter from my mother to Iranian president Banisadr&#x2014;a review of which brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, of course, your father was a CIA agent,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>It was not the first time I&#x2019;d heard her say this. I suppose a review of salient facts did suggest a career in intelligence: low-profile jobs in defense and high-tech industries. Broad knowledge of Iran. And he was caught up in an international incident that somehow never got any play beyond those couple paragraphs in the <i>Tehran Times</i>. But a CIA agent? I remembered him as an academic whose greatest hours were spent in the company of books. A hunter. A mindful adventurer who could never quite get enough of mountain ranges, seascapes, and the oddities of different cultures. It irked me, hearing her call Dad a spy.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about Dad&#x2019;s arrest,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why must we talk about the past when you know it gives me a headache?&#x201d; she replied&#x2014;never mind that the past was all around us, splayed out in an accordion of yellowed documents. &#x201c;Anyway, haven&#x2019;t you heard this story enough times?&#x201d;</p><p>I knew the tale well enough, but somehow it had never sat right. My father was too sincere to traffic in government secrets. His love for Iran was genuine. But ever since the CIA had organized a revolution in 1953, Iranians have come to distrust the motivations of Americans. Just a couple of years ago, three American hikers had been accused of espionage after &#x201c;inadvertently&#x201d; crossing into Iran. It was of course a perfectly ridiculous claim&#x2014;every bit as absurd as their choice of destination&#x2014;but it prompted my mother into her latest act of volunteer diplomacy. She drew up a letter to Hillary Clinton offering personally to negotiate their freedom.</p><p>&#x201c;I sacrificed much more for your father, a real-life spy, so why shouldn&#x2019;t I defend these innocents?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t cross her mind that at eighty, she might no longer have the connections needed to pull it off. But even today, you cannot underestimate her.</p><p>Sadly, she did not hear back from Secretary of State Clinton. Or maybe she never got around to mailing the letter. But that afternoon for the gazillionth time, she recounted the events leading to my father&#x2019;s capture and resulting trial.</p><p>Through the years, with each retelling, I felt a deeper regret that I didn&#x2019;t know my father better. All children have unresolved questions about their parents, of course, but this was no trifling matter. Was he a spy? Then it struck me: I had a file on my father. If he had been a CIA agent, they&#x2019;d have a file on him, too.</p><p>That week, in a bid to put the past to rest once and for all&#x2014;for myself and my mother and sister&#x2014;I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the CIA. Passed into law by President Clinton, the act allows previously classified documents that were more than twenty-five years old to be released. If my father were a CIA agent, his file would certainly meet these guidelines. A dead agent doesn&#x2019;t worry about his cover being blown, right? I also filed inquiries with the FBI, the Department of Defense, the State Department, and President Carter. A flurry of letters flew out into the world, each a bid to open my father&#x2019;s long-dormant past. I held out hope that someone, somewhere knew something&#x2014;and, like the file I&#x2019;d unearthed, that thing would fall gracefully into place.</p><p>Which just shows you how much I know about the world of intelligence.</p><p>While waiting for responses to come in, I began writing this book. My mother&#x2019;s story is easy to tell for she is an ardent, often glittering storyteller. My father&#x2019;s was trickier&#x2014;the dead tell no tales. He was a notoriously private man. The story of his capture, imprisonment, and trial I pieced together from journals, notes, memories, and shards of conversation I recall from quieter moments. But much of his interior life and motivations had been shrouded from me.</p><p>While writing, a curious thing happened. At times I heard his voice in my head, which was lovely and disconcerting. I began to feel closer to him.</p><p>I have an American father and an Iranian mother. I have the blood of the Great Satan and the Axis of Evil in my veins. The year 1979 launched the Iranian revolution and Islamic fundamentalism on an unready world, and in revisiting that year and its dramatic events, I saw how the fracture between the two countries was written into my parents&#x2019; marriage&#x2014;and played itself out in microcosm while Iran and America did battle. Our story was a prism. While all eyes were on the hostages, our crisis played out in jail, in court, across international borders&#x2014;and in private.</p><p>Was my dad a spy? Were the charges leveled against him true? Were my father alive today, he&#x2019;d have pushed up his glasses and said in a voice that left little room for discussion, &#x201c;Cyrus, I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201d; But we Copelands had an adventure, a tale that goes back three decades to the fault lines between Iran and America. And it needs to be told.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART 1</p><p></p><p></p><p>SHAHIN</p><p>TEHRAN, 1979</p><p>In America, a peanut farmer rules the free world. Here a king is deposed from his peacock throne, ending twenty-five hundred years of monarchy. God have mercy, the revolution has arrived.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been months since the Shah left&#x2014;leaving the country in the hands of bearded hooligans and a rotating roster of ministers, most of whom last barely longer than a carton of milk. The prisons have been emptied and refilled. Each day brings more prohibitions: ties, perfume, nail polish, makeup. And more executions: generals, SAVAK agents, Communists, drug offenders, Kurds, Bahais, intellectuals, political dissidents and holdovers from the prior regime, their names written on their foreheads for identification&#x2014;their blood running from Evin&#x2019;s prison grounds.</p><p>Welcome to the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><p>For the record, her name is Shahin Maleki Copeland. She is an inveterate royalist and always will be. Did the Shah not launch a White Revolution that gave women the vote, peasants the land they&#x2019;d farmed, illiterates an education, industrial workers the right to profits, Iran&#x2019;s forests protection, and the farthest villages access to public healthcare? But you don&#x2019;t hear about any of that, for bloodless revolutions rarely make headlines. Better a red revolution to take Iran back a century.</p><p>Not only does she disavow herself of all this, Shahin notes with pleasure how the Islamic Republic was certified on April 1, when the gullible are taken for a good laugh. Her countrymen marched, fought, died, ransacked, burned, stared down the barrels of guns&#x2014;and now celebrated. <i>The revolution has succeeded! Become martyrs in the path of righteousness!</i> It&#x2019;s as if they&#x2019;d read the Che Guevara handbook on revolution, mixed it with fundamentalist Islam, and were now drunk on their unmixable principles. &#x201c;Brother&#x201d; and &#x201c;sister,&#x201d; they called each other.</p><p>It was the best of times followed by the worst of times.</p><p>Mornings as she passes the newsstand, Shahin glances at the headlines and photographs of executed men. She wonders if it bothers her compatriots that blood flows freely and vengefully, or that Tehran&#x2019;s walls are defaced with ugly slogans calling for death. Death is all around them. By daylight and moonlight, men patrol the streets like hounds in search of Communist, royalist, traitor, and dissident&#x2014;carting them off to destinations unknown. As SAVAK had done. Stories of abduction are whispered over tea: <i>Gereftanesh.</i> A single word, shorthand for capture and probable death: <i>&#x201c;They got him.&#x201d;</i></p><p>November 25, 1979: Today, as she sets the table, Shahin realizes Max still has not arrived. Usually he is home by seven, whistling in the stairwell. It&#x2019;s nine P.M. Kebabs and rice are on the table, losing steam. &#x201c;Where is Dad?&#x201d; the kids want to know.</p><p>&#x201c;He went hunting,&#x201d; Shahin says, the facility of her lie surprising her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hunting?&#x201d; Katayoun asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Hunting. Yes. Your father decided&#x2014;spontaneously&#x2014;to take a trip up north,&#x201d; Shahin says, expanding the lie and giving it room to breathe. &#x201c;Now eat.&#x201d;</p><p>In truth she has no idea where Max might be.</p><p>Her thoughts turn to the American embassy. A couple of weeks ago, some ruffians seized the embassy for the second time. Shahin remembers that day; the gods had set the mood perfectly. A misty gloom hung over Tehran. A light rain fell. In the late afternoon, her sister Mahin had called with news of the takeover. Shahin turned on the TV to see a gleeful mob parading its blindfolded Americans, chanting death to Carter, death to imperialism. By now death was so invoked, so ingrained in the language that she thought she was immune to it. But this? She felt embarrassed that Iran&#x2019;s new face to the world was a horde of bloodthirsty hoodlums with no international etiquette.</p><p>Doubtless they&#x2019;d been elated to discover the pile of documents, three CIA agents, and a cache of weapons&#x2014;all of which confirmed their worst suspicions about America. Finally the revolution had found a unifying event. And hundreds of thousands took to the streets in jubilant agreement.</p><p>&#x201c;This is not an occupation. We have thrown out the occupiers!&#x201d; Ayatollah Khomeini proclaimed.</p><p>It does not take a Nobel laureate to appreciate that of all the times in Iran&#x2019;s history, this was the most inauspicious, the absolute worst, for Max to go missing. But over dinner Shahin feels a strange calm descend. After the kids retire to their rooms to finish homework, she remains anchored at the table watching the hours tick by.</p><p>Come midnight, Max is still missing.</p><p>Where, she wonders, does one search for a missing American husband? She&#x2019;d been married to Max for twenty-plus years, mostly good, but ever since the revolution had ignited she&#x2019;d sensed a growing rift. The night of the embassy takeover they&#x2019;d argued fiercely. Where was the sense of international decency, Max wanted to know. The goddamn moral outrage? Where was the recognition that America had been riding roughshod over Iran for years, Shahin demanded. She&#x2019;d not take any criticism of Iran, not now, not from an American, not when Carter had sold out her beloved Shah for a barrel of oil. The argument had ended the way most did, with Max seething and silent. That was a week ago. Now he was gone.</p><p>The following morning, she stops at Laleh hospital, a couple of blocks from home. The overwhelming nausea she&#x2019;s already feeling has nothing to do with the antiseptic smells wafting in the corridors.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you admitted a Dr. Copeland? A tall American man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does he work here?&#x201d; the admitting clerk asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh&#x2014;no, he&#x2019;s not that kind of doctor. He&#x2019;s a Ph.D. And my husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; the clerk says with a hint of derision. Unshaved, he barely looks at her. Yesterday people like him had washed her windows, clipped her hedges, and shined her shoes. &#x201c;We have no record of him here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she replies, the words like vinegar on her tongue.</p><p>For the next fifteen hours, this scene plays like a recurring nightmare: Surly, uninterested clerks who&#x2019;ve forgotten their humble beginnings brushing her off. (Bad enough her husband is missing, Shahin&#x2019;s life has become a scene from a Marxist play.) The response is always the same. At the hospital, the police station, the prison, the morgue: <i>We have no record of him.</i> Shahin crisscrosses Tehran knowing that with every passing hour her chances of finding Max diminish.</p><p>One hour bleeds into the next.</p><p>One prayer gives way to a hundred.</p><p>At eleven P.M. she returns home husbandless. She has not eaten&#x2014;a missing husband is a wonderful appetite suppressant&#x2014;and collapses onto the sofa. &#x201c;Will you rub my legs?&#x201d; she asks Katayoun.</p><p>That night, Shahin prays formally for the first time in years. On a rug. Facing Mecca. This was the Islamic Republic, but the mullahs weren&#x2019;t the only ones with a line to God. Midprayer, she stops short, and in the way a piece of the puzzle eventually comes forward, she remembers Max&#x2019;s driver. <i>Surely he would know Max&#x2019;s last whereabouts.</i> She doesn&#x2019;t bother excusing herself from God, but gathers her skirt and leaves. An hour later, she stands in the alley outside Javad&#x2019;s house, and when he doesn&#x2019;t answer his buzzer, Shahin yells: &#x201c;JAVAD!&#x201d; He comes downstairs, looking like he&#x2019;s seen a ghost&#x2014;which Shahin attributes to the surprise of seeing her at midnight minus makeup. In this dark alley on the other side of Tehran&#x2019;s tracks, the two of them are briefly stunned by the improbability of this rendezvous. Shahin pulls him into the shadows. &#x201c;Dr. Copeland is missing&#x2014;do you know where my husband is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sincere apologies, <i>khanoum</i>,*<i> nah</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you take him yesterday?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To the warehouse. I returned after lunch, but he wasn&#x2019;t there. I assumed he&#x2019;d gotten a cab.&#x201d;</p><p>That sounded right. Max was in charge of closing out the affairs of Westinghouse&#x2019;s employees&#x2014;selling their belongings to the public, returning to the warehouse after each sale to record the proceeds. But something is wrong. Javad won&#x2019;t look at her. So Shahin takes a step toward him and in a move that surprises her, a desperate and conceivably widowed woman, she puts her hand to his throat and pushes Javad against the wall.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me where my husband is. I have a gun in my purse and will shoot you.&#x201d;</p><p>A year ago, Shahin had been a woman of decorum&#x2014;gliding through Iran&#x2019;s upper echelons and hobnobbing with university presidents and four-star generals. She had an American husband. Two children.

Bored with rain, sun, fog, and snow, King Derwin of Didd summons his royal magicians to create something new and exciting to fall from the sky. What he gets is a storm of sticky green globs called Oobleck, which soon causes a royal mess. But with the assistance of the wise page boy Bartholomew, the king (along with young readers) learns that the simplest words can sometimes solve the biggest problems.</p></p><p><i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</i> easily qualifies as a Seuss classic, first told way back in 1949. And its message--the importance of owning up to your mistakes and saying that you're sorry--is as timeless now as it was then.<p> Bartholomew Cubbins serves thanklessly as pageboy to King Derwin of Didd, a headstrong man who's decided he isn't satisfied with mere sun, fog, rain, and snow. ("Humph! The things that come down from my sky!") He wants something <i>else</i>, something uniquely his own, so he calls in his royal magicians ("Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff. Fista, wista, mista-cuff. We are men of groans and howls, mystic men who eat boiled owls"). Happy to oblige, the magicians tell the king they can make "oobleck" fall from the sky, only nobody--not even the magicians--knows just what oobleck is. But after a night of arcane incantations, everyone in the kingdom gets a taste of the stuff (in the case of the Captain of the Guard, literally!), as the green, gluey goo gums up everything in sight.</p><p> Of course, Bartholomew tries to help, but it's up to the king to save the day, as he learns to utter not magic words but simple words with magic in them: "I'm sorry."

Washington: American Democracy and the Idea of Race Relations</h2><p>Booker T. Washington has long held an ambiguous position in the pantheon of black leadership. Lauded by some in his own lifetime as a black George Washington, he was also derided by others as a Benedict Arnold. In <i>The Education of Booker T. Washington</i>, Michael West offers a major reinterpretation of one of the most complex and controversial figures in American history. West reveals the personal and political dimensions of Washington's journey "up from slavery." He explains why Washington's ideas resonated so strongly in the post-Reconstruction era and considers their often negative influence in the continuing struggle for equality in the United States. West's work also establishes a groundwork for understanding the ideological origins of the civil rights movement and discusses Washington's views on the fate of race and nation in light of those of Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and others. <br><br>West argues that Washington's analysis was seen as offering a "solution" to the problem of racial oppression in a nation professing its belief in democracy. That solution was the idea of "race relations." In practice, this theory buttressed segregation by supposing that African Americans could prosper within Jim Crow's walls and without the normal levers by which other Americans pursued their interests. Washington did not, West contends, imagine a way to perfect democracy and an end to the segregationist policies of southern states. Instead, he offered an ideology that would obscure the injustices of segregation and preserve some measure of racial peace. <br><br>White Americans, by embracing Washington's views, could comfortably find a way out of the moral and political contradictions raised by the existence of segregation in a supposedly democratic society. This was (and is) Washington's legacy: a form of analysis, at once obvious and concealed, that continues to prohibit the realization of a truly democratic politics.</p><p>In this major reconsideration of Booker T. Washington&#39;s life and thought, Michael Rudolph West explores why Washington&#39;s ideas resonated so strongly in the post-Reconstruction era and considers their often negative influence on the ongoing struggle for equality in the United States. According to West, Washington&#39;s &#34;race relations&#34; offered a &#34;solution&#34; to the problem of racial oppression in a nation professing its belief in democracy. In practice, though, his theories lent support to the supposition that African Americans could prosper under Jim Crow without the normal levers by which other Americans pursued their interests. West contends that Washington did not seek to end the segregationist policies of southern states. Instead, he offered an ideology that would obscure the injustices of segregation and preserve some measure of racial peace. By embracing Washington&#39;s views, white Americans could then resolve the contradictions raised by segregation in a supposedly democratic society. This was (and is) Washington&#39;s legacy: a form of racial analysis, at once obvious and concealed, that continues to prohibit the realization of a truly democratic politics.Michael Rudolph West is associate professor of history and director of Africana Studies at the College of the Holy Cross.</p><h2>Pearson Texas United States History: Colonization Through Reconstruction Grade 8 Teacher&#39;s Edition TE</h2><p>TEACHER&#39;S EDITION - To be used in conjunction with the student version that has ISBN-13: 9780133313277 and ISBN-10: 0133313271.</p><p></p><h2>Fever (Thorndike Press Large Print Core Series)</h2><p>Presents a fictionalized account of the life of Typhoid Mary, an Irish immigrant who moved to New York at the turn of the century and became a successful cook, until the Department of Health noticed the trail of disease she left behind.</p><p><p><b>Julia Glass on <i>Fever</i> by Mary Beth Keane</b></p> <p><strong>How I Almost Missed Out on a New Favorite Author</strong></p> <p>Every so often, you&#x2019;ll come across a book that burns so hot and bright it&#x2019;ll sear a shadow on your vision. For a while afterwards, everything you look at will have the book&#x2019;s imprint on it; your world will be colored in the book&#x2019;s tones, and you will glimpse the book&#x2019;s characters on the street and feel your heart knocking in your chest for a few blocks, as if you&#x2019;d escaped a close call.</p> <p>I did not deliberately choose to read Mary Beth Keane&#x2019;s first novel, <i>The Walking People</i>. It came to me in a blizzard of books I read as one of three judges for a literary prize back in 2010. I took my responsibility seriously, even primly; one thing that worried me was how strongly my personal biases would influence my choices. (Was I supposed to be impartial? Of course not. But any passionately written book deserves enormous respect.)</p> <p> So here is where I admit that I was barely a few pages into <i>The Walking People</i> when my heart sank. I recognized it as a story involving Irish immigrants to America. Just then, I happened to be weary of immigrant stories in general, nor did it help that I had recently, belatedly, read the incomparable <i>Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i>. And&#x2014;second confession&#x2014;I was raised by a mother with Scots-Presbyterian roots who had tainted my generally egalitarian self with her lifelong grudge against Irish Catholics. As I knew all too well, the most traumatic bullying she&#x2019;d experienced as a child came from Catholic schoolmates&#x2014;who taunted the Protestants as destined for hell because they couldn&#x2019;t go to confession. But I digress.</p> <p> I had vowed to read at least 50 pages of every book I was to judge, so I took <i>The Walking People</i> with me on an overnight trip I made alone, to give a talk. Perhaps the only way to keep my promise to this book would be to hold myself hostage to it in a hotel&#x2014;with nothing for diversion but the bedside Bible and the cable listings. That night, I went to bed without reading, exhausted; in the morning, I decided to hang out with the dreaded book until 9:00 a.m. or so, just to avoid rush-hour traffic. Sighing, I opened it. When I next looked up at the clock, it was 11:15, past checkout time. I had lost not only my connection to real time but very nearly an extra night in hotel fees.</p> <p>I drove home, stashed my suitcase, and plunged back into the book. Every so often I&#x2019;d flip to the end and look at the author&#x2019;s photo. How on earth did this fresh-faced young woman&#x2014;from my middle-aged perspective, this <i>girl</i>&#x2014;know so damn much about so many things? I&#x2019;ll skip all the exquisite historic and cultural details of that novel. What Mary Beth Keane knows best, and most remarkably, is how the human heart grows, changes, and endures. She seems to know intimately every stage of life, from childhood through sexual awakening, through long marriages and parenthood, through working lives filled with compromise, through the mental dwindlings of old age.</p> <p>Out of more than a hundred accompished books, I and my fellow judges named <i>The Walking People</i> one of the top five contenders for the PEN/Hemingway Prize. At the ceremony, I met Mary Beth, and I asked what her next act would be. Later, I paused to wonder: Wait. Did she really say, &#x201c;A novel about Typhoid Mary&#x201d;? (Okay, so maybe my hearing is starting to go. The room was awfully crowded.)</p> <p>Last year, finally, I read <i>Fever</i>. And you might say I read it in a fever&#x2014;the fever of emotional suspense that makes all the best books so essential. Does it involve Irish immigrants? Yes. Did I give a hoot? No. Mary Mallon is a show-stopping, strong-willed, heartbreaking heroine, and the New York in which she lived a hundred years ago comes stunningly alive as the backdrop for the story of her long and rich but star-crossed life.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s something I know firsthand: second novels that follow prizewinning firsts are tough. They&#x2019;re tough to write, tough to send out into the world. But <i>Fever</i> is even more ambitious, beguiling, and moving than <i>The Walking People</i>. Mary Beth has outdone herself. And now, of course, I have to find out what in the world she&#x2019;ll conjure up next. This time I&#x2019;ll trust my hearing. Already I can&#x2019;t wait to read it.</p>Mary Beth Keane<b> </b>was born in New York City to Irish parents and grew up in Rockland County, New York.

Now, held hostage on a distant reservation for reasons she cannot at first fathom, Miranda finds herself battling a captor who is by turns harsh and tender, mysteriously aloof and dangerously seductive.<br><br>Hawk had assumed that Miranda Price, the beautiful ex-wife of Representative Price, would be as selfish and immoral as the tabloids suggested.

Rat Dog relies on an ancient Everex 286 computer (Evil Evie), a Toyota Tercel (The Frog Prince) that is so outrageously green it's useless for surveillance, and a big, funny-looking dog (Beans). She is probably the best skip tracer (someone who finds people) in San Francisco. Once she gets her teeth into the "Foxglove" case--several old people who dwindle and die quickly after being "befriended" by a local Gypsy family--the fact that she has no client to pay her for her work is just not an issue. The police are ignoring clear evidence of elder abuse, and Rat Dog is outraged. We follow every step of her adventures as she learns a whole lot about Gypsies and turns into a fierce advocate for the elderly.<p> Jack Olsen's prose style is supple and engaging, with funny dialogue and colorful characters worthy of an Elmore Leonard novel.

Ever since the Supreme Court's landmark <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision, abortion has in many ways defined American politics, creating an ideological demilitarized zone between liberals and conservatives. Above all, the twenty-five-year war over abortion has been responsible for the most significant social phenomenon of our times&#x2014;the political and cultural mobilization of Evangelical America. Furthermore, it has served as the lightning rod for the most intense and prolonged debate on the issue of separation of church and state since the founding of the nation.Now for the first time, in a compelling and very human narrative, <i>Wrath of Angels</i> traces the rise and fall of the American anti-abortion movement and reveals its critical role in the creation of the Religious Right. The book explores why the passionate battle to end abortion failed to achieve its goal and yet in the process became one of the most important&#x2014;and least understood&#x2014;social protest movements of the twentieth century. The anti-abortion movement was the catalyst that convinced Protestant fundamentalists to end their long cultural isolation, leaving their church pews for the streets. And, while they failed to change the law, they were transformed themselves, emerging as one for the most potent political forces in America at the end of the century.James Risen, an investigative reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> and Judy L. Thomas, a reporter for the <i>Kansas City Star,</i> are widely acknowledged as the leading journalistic experts on the anti-abortion movement. Their narrative history captures all the drama of the abortion battles of the past twenty-five years and reveals how a movement with its roots in the Catholic left's antiwar protests of the 1960s was gradually transformed into a rallying point for the newly muscular Religious Right. <i>Wrath of Angels</i> documents the origins of the use of civil disobedience in the anti-abortion movement and offers the definitive explanation of why the movement ultimately descended into violence&#x2014;and collapsed as a political force. It tells the compelling story of the shootings of abortion doctors in the 1990s and draws upon exclusive interviews with the anti-abortion extremists who have been convicted of these crimes.Anti-abortion activism represents the largest social protest movement since the 1960s. With clarity and objectivity, Risen and Thomas unleash the stormy wrath of angels, the volatile eruption of fundamentalist fury into American politics.</p><p><b>Jim Risen</b> is an investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i><b>Judy Thomas</b> reports for the <i>Kansas City Star.</i> Both have been nominees for the Pulitzer Prize.During the past 25 years, abortion has mobilized conservative Protestant fundamentalists, now a major political force, and it continues to play a role in American politics. Here, journalists Risen and Thomas trace the history of the anti-abortion movement from its beginning in the leftist Catholic antiwar movement, with its opposition to all forms of killing, to its transformation into a splintered, right-wing, fundamentalist movement with violent factions willing to bomb clinics and murder doctors to save the unborn. The authors, who have done extensive research, include interviews with anti-abortion extremists such as Randall Terry, John Bray, and Joan Andrews. The documentary approach makes the book interesting. By focusing on a specific time period, it is less comprehensive than Leslie J. Reagan's When Abortion Was a Crime (Univ. of California, 1997), but the extensive bibliography provides access to more information. Highly recommended for all collections.?Barbara M.

The Zygote Chronicles is her singular take on the next leg of the journey -- a riotous and poignant novel in journal form that takes us from conception to delivery room. Through the voice of a whip-smart, sass-talking everywoman Zygote reveals the unsettling and uproarious truth about pregnancy and the prospect of motherhood. The Zygote Chronicles will resonate for any woman who has even briefly considered motherhood. The strange purgatory of pregnancy has been a fact of life since Eve ate the apple, but never has it been recounted in such brilliant, hilarious detail.</p><p>"This is the time of real butter," writes Suzanne Finnamore in <i>The Zygote Chronicles</i>, her fictional journal of pregnancy. In fresh, fed-up language, Finnamore (<i>Otherwise Engaged</i>) captures the universal truths of pregnancy that can seem almost insultingly personal when they happen to you. Finnamore sings the joys of whole cream dairy products, but the blues make themselves heard as well. The narrator, an advertising executive, frets about her credibility at work. "I'm a little worried that I won't have any authority left when I get big and have Pamela Anderson breasts. I may have to compensate in some way. I may have to start carrying a hammer." Women have always been funny about pregnancy, and Finnamore gets all that black humor down on paper. It should be noted, however, that the narrator's grousing can wear a bit thin, given her station in life (she laments giving up her Miata for an SUV). Even so, <i>The Zygote Chronicles</i> should take its place alongside Anne Lamott's <i>Operating Instructions</i> as essential reading for the intelligent breeder. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Back Jacket blurb: &#34;One of the best, kindest, most touching, most readable, and female of books - also one of the most instructive, not only on pregnancy but on all kinds of human matters.&#39;--Fay Weldon</p><h2>Heroes Die</h2><p>He lives in two worlds...but he doesn&#39;t want to die in either one.</p><p></p><h2>Knotcraft: The Practical and Entertaining Art of Tying Knots</h2><p><p>What's the difference between a square knot and a granny knot? What kinds of knots do fishermen use? How do you make a rope ladder? A tourniquet? What's the best way to secure a boat to its mooring, or pitch a tent? How do you tie stretcher knots?<br>These questions and many others are answered in Allan and Paulette Macfarlan's encyclopedic work on the practical art of knot tying. Knowing how to tie a variety of useful and reliable knots is a necessity for weekend sailors and campers: it's a passport to safety and success. Rock climbing, horseback riding, and other outdoor activities also inspire the enthusiast to pursue the requisite knots.<br>In unusually clear illustrations rendered by artist Paulette Macfarlan, accompanied by precise written instructions, the authors of this book explain how to tie hundreds of knots, including basic knots, stopper knots and hitches, toggled knots, knots for joining two ends of rope, hitches and knots for typing ropes to things, whipping, seizings, loop knots, horsey knots and hitches, decorative knots, lashing, and splicing. Practical applications are also discussed: rappelling, raft building, tracking a canoe or small boat, heaving line, log rolling, making a travois, and rope tent-frames, beds, and bunks.<br>In addition to discussing the practical side of knot tying, the Macfarlans cover the entertaining end of the craft: knots and ropes in history and literature, knot mystery and magic in ancient and contemporary times, and games, tricks, and stunts with ropes and knots. Nearly every aspect of knot tying is represented in this comprehensive and concise reference work.

Pastor Jim Cymbala believes that in the face of unspeakable tragedy, God is reaching out to the heart of a grieving city, to the people of a wounded nation, and to a world that fears what the future may hold. God&#x2019;s Grace from Ground Zero assures us that God hates the senseless evil that destroyed thousands of lives, and that this is a time when he is pouring out his mercy in a special way. The harvest is ripe, hearts that were closed are open to the gospel, and today, not tomorrow, is when we have the opportunity and responsibility to express Jesus through our words and through our deeds. Now is the time to love our families, our friends, and those around us. Now is the time to trust God and live for him like never before. And now, in the midst of our grief, our fear, and our lack of answers for things that make no sense, is the time to worship God with all our hearts.</p><p>Jim Cymbala has been the pastor of The Brooklyn Tabernacle for more than twenty-five years. The author of the best-selling titles Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire; Fresh Faith; and Fresh Power, he lives in New York City with his wife, Carol Cymbala, who directs the Grammy Award-winning Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.In his most stridently evangelical book yet, Cymbala (Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire; Fresh Faith; etc.) examines the nation's mood after September 11 and declares that it is now "harvest time" for Christians. After the terrorist attacks, Cymbala says, Americans are more open to spirituality and especially to the message of Christianity. Americans are now "conscious of their vulnerability and need," an awakening evidenced by the overflowing pews at the Brooklyn Tabernacle that Cymbala pastors. While not all readers will agree with the zealous evangelical spirit that drives this book, they will be touched by its stories, particularly the tales of the four Brooklyn Tabernacle church members who were killed in the attack on the World Trade Center, and the chilling account of another member who got out of the building in the nick of time. Cymbala criticizes the response of some unnamed Christians (read: Jerry Falwell) who were quick to place blame and point fingers after the tragedy. He also notes the futility of "analyzing prophecy charts or splitting theological hairs" to try to understand how the attack fits into Christian beliefs about the end of the world. "Jesus clearly said that we will never fully understand prophetic times and seasons," he explains. The more important task for Christians, he says, is to be fully engaged in redeeming the world and its people. This well-written, poignant book will help many evangelical Christians cling to hope in the wake of disaster. (Nov. 16)Forecast: Since January of 1999, Cymbala has had at least one book on the CBA bestseller list at all times, and he has won numerous accolades, including the ECPA Gold Medallion for Book of the Year in 2000 for Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire. Expect strong sales for this title, which has an initial print run of 100,000 copies.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Ground Zero: Collected Essays</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Holleran recreates that vanished time and place: gay New York, when no one knew the way out in his tender elegies for his dead and dying friends, in masterfully rendered imagery&#x2014;a polluted Fire Island shore mirrors a sea of potentially diseased partners&#x2014;and in examining the paradoxes of survival&#x2014;a French journalist transcends the mediocrity and materialism of his previous life by writing an internationally renowned novel on the very disease that's killing him. Confusion and terror radiate from these pages, and humor of the blackest variety predominates (a young man endows a rubber in his pants pocket with the talismanic quality of a crucifix in a land of vampires).

In 2011, Mayor&#x2019;s 22nd Joe Gunther novel, TAG MAN, earned a place on <i> The New York Times </i> bestseller list for hardback fiction. </p><p> Before turning his hand to fiction, Mayor wrote history books, the most notable of which, <i> Southern Timberman: The Legacy of William Buchanan, </i> concerned the lumber and oil business in Louisiana from the 1870s to the 1970s. This book was published in 1988 and very well received; it was republished as a trade paperback in 2009. </p><p> Archer Mayor is a death investigator for Vermont&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a detective for the Windham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, the publisher of his own backlist, a travel writer for AAA, and he travels the Northeast giving speeches and conducting workshops. He has 25 years of experience as a volunteer firefighter/EMT. Mayor was brought up in the US, Canada and France and had been employed as a scholarly editor, a researcher for TIME-LIFE Books, a political advance-man, a theater photographer, a newspaper writer/editor, a lab technician for <i> Paris-Match Magazine </i> in Paris, France, and a medical illustrator. In addition to writing novels and occasional articles, Mayor gives talks and workshops all around the country, including the Bread Loaf Young Writers conference in Middlebury, Vermont, and the Colby College seminar on forensic sciences in Waterville, Maine. </p><p> Mayor&#x2019;s critically-acclaimed series of police novels feature Lt. Joe Gunther of the Brattleboro, Vermont, police department. The books, which have been appearing about once a year since 1988, have been published in five languages (if you count British), and routinely gather high praise from such sources as <i>The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New Yorker,</i> and others, often appearing on their &#x201c;ten best&#x201d; yearly lists. </p><p> Whereas many writers base their books only on interviews and scholarly research, Mayor&#x2019;s novels are based on actual experience in the field. The result adds a depth, detail and veracity to his characters and their tribulations that has led <i>The New York Times</i> to call him &#x201c;the boss man on procedures&#x201d;.</p><p>To set the stage: Abraham Fuller has died in the hospital of a bullet wound received twenty years ago. Baffled by what is automatically an ancient homicide case, Joe and his colleagues go the near-hermit&#x2019;s secluded home on property owned by a man named Conyers, to search for clues. There they find a grave with a skeleton equipped with a shiny metal knee.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello, Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p> <p>I turned away from the jumble of people setting up staging and equipment by the roped-off grave site and saw Beverly Hillstrom coming toward me. I had called her right after discovering the skeleton, to ask her advice on how to deal with it. It was now ten a.m. the following morning.</p> <p>I smiled at her with genuine pleasure and shook her slim, elegant hand. &#x201c;Doctor. It&#x2019;s wonderful to see you; I thought one of your regional MEs would be attending. I didn&#x2019;t know you were coming.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to initially, but then I couldn&#x2019;t resist it. Besides, once I&#x2019;d recommended a forensic archeologist, I thought the least I could do was to introduce him personally.&#x201d;</p> <p>She turned and gestured to a short, wiry man whose face was as bushy with black hair as his head was gleaming bald. His eyes looked enormous behind thick, dark-framed glasses, and he squinted at me slightly as we exchanged formalities, as if considering what a slice of me would look like under a microscope.</p> <p>Hillstrom beamed between us, the immaculate hostess. &#x201c;Dr. Boris Leach-Lieutenant Joe Gunther.&#x201d; Leach&#x2019;s eyes shifted away from me after a cursory glance, focusing instead on the activities by the hole. His hand was cold and limp in mine and I dropped it as soon as I could.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lieutenant, I take it no one has aggravated the hole any further?&#x201d; He stepped around me and ducked under the yellow mylar &#x201c;Police Line&#x201d; we&#x2019;d used to surround the site.</p> <p>Hillstrom patted my arm quickly and smiled, encouraging me to ignore Leach&#x2019;s arrogant tone of voice. I realized then she wasn&#x2019;t here purely out of professional curiosity. When I&#x2019;d called her about the skeleton, she&#x2019;d warned me that Leach was no Miss Manners; she&#x2019;d obviously decided upon reflection to run interference between us.</p> <p>I lifted the barrier for her and we followed in Leach&#x2019;s wake. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the way we left it last night, except for what your assistant dropped off a while ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>He stood at the edge of the hole, now illuminated by the bright, cool sunlight. The metal knee joint shone like a white spark, nestled in its pit. He looked around suddenly, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the back hoe? I told Henry to specifically request a back hoe. I can&#x2019;t be expected to remove four feet of dirt by myself. It&#x2019;s idiotic... Pointless.&#x201d;</p> <p>I held up my hand to interrupt him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming, Doctor; it should be here in a few minutes. What about everything else?&#x201d; That sidetracked him for a while. He left us to examine the pile of equipment his twitchy, birdlike &#x201c;assistant&#x201d; Henry had brought in a pickup truck some forty-five minutes earlier.</p> <p>Watching him, I muttered to Hillstrom, &#x201c;Too many years digging in the Gobi Desert?&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled like an indulgent mother. &#x201c;Take the bad with the good, Lieutenant. This man is very good.&#x201d;</p> <p>Leach returned from his inventory and fixed me with his fierce, owl-wide eyes. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the forensics man on your team?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;J.P. Tyler.&#x201d; I shouted over to J.P., who was doing his own surreptitious examination of Leach&#x2019;s assembled hardware.</p> <p>Rather than waiting for Tyler to join us, Leach marched off and made his own introductions. Both men took hammers and large spikes and set off toward opposite trees near the grave site. Once there, they drove the spikes into the trunks, fastened them to the ends of two reeled measuring tapes, and unrolled the tapes toward the hole, establishing both a double set of fixed surveying points, and an accurate triangulation system. From now on, all maps of the site would feature the two trees, and all items on that map would be measured from them. Indeed, even as I was admiring the simple efficiency of the plan, I saw Leach thrust a drawing pad, a pencil, and a ruler into Tyler&#x2019;s hands.</p> <p>At that point, Leach shouted over to Hillstrom. &#x201c;You can play photographer now, if you want to earn your keep.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hillstrom merely chuckled and pulled a camera from the bag hanging off her shoulder. Even considering our friendship, it never would have occurred to me to address her in such a tone.</p> <p>From that point on, Dr. Leach was like a caricature general in the field, shouting orders to his troops, and doing most of the work himself.</p> <p>After a quick sketch of the scene as it was, the surface debris of leaves and stray stones was cleared away to reveal the true topography of the land. Shovels were handed out, and slowly, inch by inch, the top layer of soil was removed over about a ten foot by five foot area, revealing at first a uniform mantle of dark, moist, nutrient-rich dirt.</p> <p>I wandered near Hillstrom at one point in this drawn-out process and asked how deep we were going to go. She shook her head in shocked amusement. &#x201c;Not to worry. That&#x2019;s why he was asking for the back hoe. Soil like this is divided into two parts: the upper layer can be about eight inches deep, like it is here, and it tends to be dark and rich. Below it is the lighter colored, generally sandier layer, which usually goes down until you hit ledge or water or whatever. The premise is that if you dig a grave, you&#x2019;ll punch through the top and burrow into the lower layer, but when you later fill in the hole, the dirt you throw in will be a mixture of both dark and light. So, years later, if you skim the dark top soil off of a larger surrounding area, chances are you&#x2019;ll discover one spot in the lighter, deeper soil which looks slightly different, because it&#x2019;s been disturbed. That&#x2019;s how you know exactly where your grave is.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But we know where the grave is,&#x201d; I persisted, unembarrassed to display my archeological ignorance.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, but we don&#x2019;t know its orientation or size. People rarely dig nice big, deep, rectangular holes for their murder victims. They do what they can in a hurry, crunch their victims up as tight as possible, and stuff them in. Boris and I have found them head first, balled up, and cut into pieces. It&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her explanation was right on the mark. At about one foot down, a barely perceptible darker patch, about three-and-a-half feet round, distinguished itself from its pale surroundings. The hole we&#x2019;d dug the night before was right at the edge of it.</p> <p>The back hoe had long since arrived, accompanied but not operated by the high strung Henry, whom Leach put to work laying out wooden stakes and a grid. Once a cut line was established, the machine began digging a wide, deep trench right next to the grave site.</p> <p>Leach stood next to me as we watched the back hoe at work. &#x201c;You ever been to a dig before?&#x201d; he asked suddenly without looking at me.</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s a pain in the ass to dig straight down. The position&#x2019;s uncomfortable, the visibility stinks, and the dirt keeps falling back into the hole. Plus, if the body&#x2019;s still ripe, the stench comes straight up at you. Much easier to put a trench alongside the site, and work at it in comfort, directly in front of you. Then it&#x2019;s more like emptying a chest of drawers, from the top one down.&#x201d;</p> <p>I was about to thank him for this unexpected tidbit when he left as abruptly as he&#x2019;d come, signaled to the back hoe operator to stop, and jumped over the trench like some bespectacled billy goat, falling to his knees at the point where the light dirt and the mixed dirt met. He used a long knife to cut a cake-sized wedge between them and then signaled to me to join him.</p> <p>I knelt down by his side and he pointed at the cleavage the wedge had left behind. &#x201c;Shovel marks left by whoever dug the hole. You can see from the scalloped cut that it was a spade-shaped shovel, about twelve inches wide at the base and slightly curved.&#x201d;</p> <p>He looked up suddenly. &#x201c;Beverly, where the hell are you? You want to take possession of this mess fast, you&#x2019;ve got to help me out.&#x201d; Hillstrom, standing nearby, shook her head silently and joined us, focusing her camera on the evidence as Leach laid out a ruler for comparison. In the meantime, I called over to Dennis to check the tool shed for a shovel fitting Leach&#x2019;s description. As I did so, I noticed State&#x2019;s Attorney James Dunn quietly joining the crowd at the police barrier, as irresistibly drawn to this death scene as he was to all the ones I&#x2019;d ever attended during his tenure. I&#x2019;d realized by now that we&#x2019;d be here most of the day; it astounded me that Dunn&#x2019;s specialized curiosity would allow him to abandon the office for so long on such short notice. Hard to keep a man from his personal interests. I gave him a small wave and went back to being a spectator. The trench now complete, Leach set to work in earnest, scraping the side of the dirt wall before him until the faintest change in color indicated he was right at the wall of the narrow, vertical, cylindrical grave. Then, as he&#x2019;d told me he would, he set to work removing the dirt from the top down. By the time he&#x2019;d reached the artificial knee, Dennis had returned with a shovel, and we took a brief pause to document that we had indeed found a match for the scars in the dirt. This was no small matter to me privately, for while everyone else was narrowly focused on the task at hand, I was still wondering if the body in the hole had anything at all to do with Abraham Fuller. The shovel was a comforting bridge over that gap. It didn&#x2019;t prove culpability; it didn&#x2019;t even point at Fuller, since it was perfectly possible that the shovel was Coyner&#x2019;s, and that he&#x2019;d buried Old-Kneecap before Fuller had appeared on the scene. Nevertheless, it was a link, until something better came along.</p> <p>The artificial knee, it turned out, was the highest point of the body, since both upper and lower leg bones angled downward from where we&#x2019;d found it. Indeed, as Leach progressively laid bare the skeleton, we could all see that it rested upside down on the nape of its neck, its torso curved and twisted skywards, and its heels tucked in so as not to stick out of the ground.</p> <p>With that much clear, but with most of the body still encased in dirt, Leach summoned Tyler, Henry, Hillstrom, and me to his side.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, this is what we&#x2019;ve got so far. You-&#x201d; he pointed at Tyler, &#x201c;Take measurements and make a sketch while I point all this out. Henry, help him out.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hillstrom had already begun taking photographs, so he left her alone and focused on me, standing before the half visible skeleton as he might have before a blackboard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking at an adult, probably fully grown, whether male or female I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s about six feet in length, which would statistically indicate a male, but that can be misleading-there are a lot of tall women around.</p> <p>&#x201c;He or she was dressed at the time of death, in what looks to be a nylon shirt and a pair of blue jeans, but he wasn&#x2019;t wearing any shoes. If he was wearing a sweater, all traces of it have long since vanished, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure he was not wearing a coat of any kind. The only buttons here are consistent with the shirt alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>I bent forward and put my eyes a few inches away from where the skeleton was held by the dirt like a bug on flypaper. All I could see was skeleton. I didn&#x2019;t know what the hell he was talking about.</p> <p>My body language gave me away. With a sigh of impatience, he began pointing out the telltale signs. &#x201c;Blue jeans, see? The zipper and the copper stress point tabs they use to secure the pocket corners have all left telltale green stains on the bone. The nylon shirt-&#x201d; he pointed at a small shred of rotted material. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only material that might survive this long; cotton and wool vanish very quickly. And here, see the plastic buttons? Also, look at the feet; no lace grommets, no leather or rubber sole, no boot nails, no nothing. Therefore: no shoes.&#x201d;</p> <p>I was beginning to see what he saw. I pointed to a mass of tiny, confetti-sized fragments that seemed to surround the entire outline of the body. &#x201c;And that?&#x201d; &#x201c;Plastic. He was wrapped in it-or she was; I&#x2019;m just saying &#x2018;he&#x2019; for convenience. Don&#x2019;t forget that.&#x201d; He pulled a small trowel from his back pocket and scratched away at his exhibit. &#x201c;Look, see those round plastic circles, like lifesavers? Those are the reinforced holes running along the top of a shower curtain. You&#x2019;ll notice they&#x2019;re all bunched together, as if they were gathered in a knot. And just below them, see that? Rope strands, indicating that the curtain had been tied off above the head, to make it a container for the body.&#x201d;</p> <p>He shifted to the feet. &#x201c;Same thing here, see? No little circles, of course, since this is the bottom of the curtain, but you can see where there are more plastic fragments from where the curtain has been bunched together, and again, here are the rope strands.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So he was wrapped in the curtain, which was tied off at both ends with rope, and dragged to the hole.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;From inside the house,&#x201d; Leach finished.</p> <p>&#x201c;Because of the lack of shoes?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Possibly, although it was apparently warm weather-no jacket, remember-so he might have been running around barefoot. But the shower curtain also implies an interior death. If he dies outside, why tear down the curtain from inside? Why not just dig the hole and dump him in? If he dies inside, possibly pouring out a lot of blood, then you&#x2019;d be more inclined to wrap him in something both handy and waterproof, like a shower curtain.&#x201d; A slow smile spread across my face, which he seemed to take as an affront, adding, &#x201c;Of course, all that&#x2019;s utterly meaningless with a body this old-just a little magic show to entertain the unwashed masses.&#x201d; He turned to Henry and Tyler. &#x201c;You finished yet? I&#x2019;d like to get this over with before next summer. Set up the rocker screens over there and filter the dirt I&#x2019;ve already removed.&#x201d;</p> <p>The next stage of Leach&#x2019;s &#x201c;magic show&#x201d; took on the more traditional appearance of a documentary on digging up dinosaurs. The back hoe was retired, the shovels stacked, and even the hand trowels put away. Now Hillstrom&#x2019;s cranky little expert was down to dental tools and toothbrushes. The fact that he was toiling over an upside-down corpse with a metal knee instead of bits and pieces of a brontosaurus gradually lost its impact. As the hours went by, most of us lost sight of the overall horror of what had led us here. Like Leach, we became locked onto one minute patch of bone and dirt after another, cataloguing with him the retrieval of each button, belt buckle, scrap of cloth, and wristwatch that gradually was pried from the hard-packed damp earth.</p> <p>Also, the skeleton itself lost its ghoulish powers as it was slowly dismantled and laid in an open body bag spread out on a stretcher, the soil supporting it having been removed and sifted through the fine-mesh rocker screens that Henry and J.P. steadily shook back and forth. James Dunn, despite his own peculiar enthusiasm, began looking distracted, glancing at his watch more and more frequently, and no doubt ruing his decision not to have sent an assistant in his place.</p> <p>The care and time finally paid off, however, when Leach quietly gestured to Hillstrom to take a photograph of the area just below the skeleton&#x2019;s inverted ribcage.

This informative narrative is full of fascinating people: Chinese people, mostly writers, who encounter American writers in various bizarre circumstances in both China and the U.S. There is a toasting scene at a Chinese banquet; a portrait of a bitter, flirtatious diplomat at a dance hall; a formal meeting with Chinese writers; a conversation with an American businessman in a hotel lobby; an evening with long-suffering Chinese intellectuals in their house; a scene in the Beijing foreigners' compound with an excited European journalist; and a scene of unwarranted hilarity at the Beijing Library. In the U.S., there is Allen Ginsberg having a bewildering conversation in Disneyland with a Chinese journalist; there is the lovely and controversial writer Zhang Jie suiting abrupt mood changes to a variety of actions; and there is the fiercely spirited Jiange Zilong singing in a Connecticut dining room, eyes closed. These are real stories told with a warm and lively humor, with a keen eye for paradox, and with fresh insight into the human drama.</p><p>4 3/4 x 8 1/4 trim. End-paper illus.

Originally written as fiction for readers of all ages, in recent decades they have been considered a children's series. <p> Since publication, Anne of Green Gables has sold over 50 million books. </p><p> The three books in this edition, </p><p><b>Anne of Green Gables</b></p><p><b> Anne of Avonlea</b></p><p><b>Anne of the Island</b></p><p><b> </b> are the first 3 volumes of the series and are the parts of the series most suited for young readers.</p></p><p>Anne (with an ?e? of course)starts out as a mistake. The elderly Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert had planned on adopting a boy to help Matthew with the chores on their Prince Edward Island farm. What are they to do with the red-haired, high-spirited girl who arrives instead?<br><br>Anne Shirley, with her boundless imagination and heart, slowly brings joy into the narrow lives of those around her, and into the lives of readers who have delighted in her adventures since Lucy Maud Montgomery began writing about her in 1905.<br><br>Anne?s courage, her enthusiasm, and her ability to love, have made her one of literature?s most beloved characters in Canada and around the world.<br><br>This beautifully illustrated volume, with a foreword by Kate Macdonald Butler, one of L. M. Montgomery?s grandchildren, is a treasure for those who find in Anne a familiar friend as well as for those who are discovering this ?kindred spirit? for the first time.Mrs. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.<br><br>There are plenty of people, in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbors business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she "ran" the Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the, Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting "cotton warp" quilts--she had, knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices-and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing eye.<br><br>She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. Thomas Lynde-a meek little man whom Avonlea people called "Rachel Lynde's husband"-was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blaire's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life.<br><br>And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?<br><br>Had it been any other man in Avonlea Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoo's enjoyment was spoiled.<br><br>"I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he's gone and why," the worthy woman finally concluded. "He doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he new visits; if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for the doctor. Yet something must have happened since List night to start him off. I'm clean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today-"<br><br>Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big, rambling orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthberfs father, as shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place living at all.<br><br>1. It's just staying, that's what," she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. "Ifs no wonder Matthew and Marilia are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body can get used to anything even to being hanged, as the Irishman said."<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Price of Freedom: How One Town Stood Up to Slavery</h2><p>When John Price took a chance at freedom by crossing the frozen Ohio river from Kentucky into Ohio one January night in 1856, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was fully enforced in every state of the union. But the townspeople of Oberlin, Ohio, believed there that all people deserved to be free, so Price started a new life in town-until a crew of slave-catchers arrived and apprehended him. When the residents of Oberlin heard of his capture, many of them banded together to demand his release in a dramatic showdown that risked their own freedom. Paired for the first time, highly acclaimed authors Dennis &amp; Judith Fradin and Pura Belpr� award-winning illustrator Eric Velasquez, provide readers with an inspiring tale of how one man's journey to freedom helped spark an abolitionist movement.</p><p><p><b>DENNIS and JUDITH BLOOM FRADIN</b> have published more than 150 books for children. They have won many awards, including the 2004 SCBWI Golden Kite Honor book award for <i>The Power of One: Daisy Bates and the Little Rock Nine</i>.

Two years later, slave hunters arrived in Oberlin, Ohio, and attempted to take him back at gunpoint. Shopkeepers, farmers, teachers, and college students formed an armed group of Rescuers to release Price. Some members of the group were former slaves, risking their own freedom. Charged with violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Rescuers spent three months in jail. They returned home with a new purpose, vowing that "No fugitive slave shall ever be taken from Oberlin either with or without a warrant, if we have power to prevent it." The picture-book format is highly effective in conveying the power of the story. In Velasquez's dramatic mixed-media and oil paintings, determination shows in the stance of the figures and the set of their facial features. The book design is masterful. The front cover highlights John Price, surrounded by some of his champions. The back cover foreshadows a betrayal, with a hand dropping a gold coin into another hand, accompanied by the sentence, "How much is one man's life worth?" On the endpapers, a dark, quiet view of the river sets the stage for the conflict to come. Full-page images and spreads draw readers directly into the action. The final image is an 1859 large-scale photo of the Rescuers taken in the courtyard of the jail. This book could be used as a nonfiction partner to Christopher Paul Curtis's Elijah of Buxton (Scholastic, 2007) and as a resource in units about slavery, the Underground Railroad, or the Civil War.-Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

By joining the basketball program at Indiana University, he broke the gentleman's agreement that had barred black players from the Big Ten, college basketball's most important conference. While enduring taunts from opponents and pervasive segregation at home and on the road, Garrett became the best player Indiana had ever had, an all-American, and in 1951, the third African American drafted in the NBA. Within a year of his graduation from IU, there were six African American basketball players on Big Ten teams. Soon tens, then hundreds, and finally thousands walked through the door Garrett had opened. </p><p><br></p></p><p><p>Tom Graham grew up in Bill Garrett's hometown and played basketball on the freshman team at Indiana University, before graduating from Harvard Law School. He practiced international law in Geneva, Switzerland, and Washington, D.C. He lives in Portland, Oregon.</p><p>Rachel Graham Cody is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Divinity School, where her focus was African American studies. She lives in Portland, Oregon.</p><b>Chapter One: October 15, 1943</b> <p> Indian summer came late to Shelbyville, a welcome respite in hard times. The war in Europe and the Pacific was taking the lives of American soldiers at a rate of more than six thousand a month -- some of them local boys drafted straight out of high school -- and though the conflict was starting to turn in the Allies' favor, the end was not yet in sight and the outcome was still uncertain. </p><p> Fear for the boys at war hung over the small Indiana town like a gray net. Families traced their loved ones' movements with stickpins and crayons on giant maps spread across kitchen tables and tried to guess where their soldiers might be headed next. Starred flags dotted windows all over town, blue for a family member in military service, gold for a son or father who would not return. A few days earlier, a fight had broken out at Walt's Bar &amp; Grille when a farmer had boasted of high wartime grain prices, saying, "This is the best year I've ever had," and a mechanic, with a son overseas, had responded with a right cross. </p><p> There were also wartime shortages: gasoline, coffee, sugar, and most other staples were rationed. But shortages did not bring dread of the next news bulletin, and making do with little was nothing new to a population that had just come through the Great Depression. In Shelbyville, as throughout the country, people were accustomed to low expectations and were told to be grateful for any job, eat what was put in front of them, wear what they had, and not whine or make trouble. Irving Berlin had captured the prevailing mood in song: "This is the army, Mr. Jones! No private rooms or telephones!" </p><p> On this warm day almost two years into the war, in the shops and offices on Shelbyville's public square, men too old to be soldiers rolled up the sleeves of their white dress shirts and loosened their short, broad ties. Everywhere radios played low in the background, the surface calm belying ears and nerves alert for news. In neat frame houses along side streets women dusted and ironed to the click and rattle of electric fans, hurrying to finish and freshen up before their men came home to have their supper, listen to Gabriel Heatter deliver the day's news with feeling ("There's good neeeews tonight!"), and sit on the porch swing to read the <i>Shelbyville Democrat.</i> </p><p> In other times and other states people might call a sunny fall day like this a football afternoon, but in Indiana's high schools it was the first day of basketball tryouts, and war or no war, few high school boys across the state could think of anything else. </p><p> At Shelbyville High School, a three-story redbrick rectangle in the town's south end, 560 boys and girls fidgeted in their homerooms waiting for the 3:20 bell. In one of those rooms five boys, the school's entire contingent of black freshmen, sat across the back now. Nearest the window Bill Garrett leaned back, stretched his arms, brought his hands together, right thumb against open left palm, and squeezed off an imaginary one-hander, his right wrist flopping forward on the follow-through. On the cusp of being handsome, three months shy of his fifteenth birthday, copper-skinned and wiry with a long rectangle of a face, Garrett had hands that belied his impassive expression: he couldn't wait to get onto the court. Turning his head right, he held his pose and arched his eyebrows at his friend, Emerson Johnson, as if to say, "It's almost time." </p><p> If Emmie was excited about the start of basketball season, he didn't show it. Johnson had a sly wit, but he spoke rarely and almost never smiled. To his right Marshall Murray was struggling to keep open his wide, saucer eyes, which had earned him the nickname "Goo Goo," after the song about a cartoon character: "Barney Google (With the Goo Goo Googly Eyes)." As the bell rang, Garrett and Johnson surrounded Murray and lifted him up, Garrett with one hand, Johnson with two. "Come on," Bill said, "let's play ball." </p><p> The three paused on the high school's wide front steps as students swirled around them, some rushing away to farm chores or after-school jobs, others stopping to flirt or gossip. Freshman tryouts wouldn't start for a few hours, and they had time to kill, but Garrett and his two friends knew they were not welcome at a lot of places uptown. On Bill's nod, they made their way through the crowd, turned their backs on Shelbyville High, and started walking east toward their old school. </p><p> Booker T. Washington Elementary School sat by itself off Harrison, Shelbyville's four-lane main street, a half-mile south of the public square on an island of land in the crook where Harrison bent sharply east, crossed the railroad track, and headed south out of town. Built in 1870, to separate black grade-schoolers from white, the building had been condemned by the State Board of Health in 1914.* In 1930, the editors of the <i>Indianapolis Recorder,</i> Indiana's largest-circulation black newspaper, had demanded improvements, calling Booker T. "that old, ugly, dilapidated building where our children have to be housed." A subsequent WPA project had stuccoed and whitewashed the walls, which were now a light gray, but little else had changed. For six grades and thirty children, Booker T. had two classrooms, two teachers, no lunchroom, and, alone among Shelbyville's schools, no gym. Every recess, regardless of weather, was spent outdoors. </p><p> One thing Booker T. had was an outdoor basketball court, one of the few in town, a patch of dusty ground with two usually netless goals near the railroad track behind the school. Bill Garrett had grown up playing there, his life tuned to the thud and ping of a dog-eared basketball bouncing on packed dirt. He played basketball all summer and after school, shoveling snow off the court in winter, often taking on older boys and grown men, some of them semipros on teams that barnstormed around central Indiana, who played rough and gave him no breaks. As he did, Garrett did not pretend to be the local high school star of the moment or imagine the hometown crowd cheering his name. Raised on Shelbyville's sidelines, he played basketball because he loved it and because there was nothing else for him to do. </p><p> Approaching Booker T., Garrett, Johnson, and Murray could see Tom Sadler and Carl "Jelly" Brown, home on leave from the Navy, playing one-on-one. Four years earlier, in the fall of 1939, Sadler and Brown had been the first black students to play varsity sports at Shelbyville High School, Sadler in football, Brown in basketball. The boys watched from the sidelines until Sadler, with a wave of his hand, said, "I got Bill," and Brown responded, "I got Goo Goo." Johnson, still small enough to be mistaken for a grade-schooler, picked up the extra ball and headed off to shoot by himself, as Sadler tossed Garrett a bounce pass and said with a chuckle, "OK, little man, show Jelly what you got." </p><p> Garrett was posted up, with his back to Brown, who stood between him and the basket. Sadler was still chuckling as Garrett feinted to his right with the ball, Brown went with the fake, and in one smooth motion Garrett swung his left foot backward and pivoted 180 degrees -- leaving Brown off-balance and behind him. With one dribble Garrett was directly under the basket. Leaping off his right foot, he reached out to the far side of the basket with his left hand and softly laid the ball backhand against the backboard so that it fell through the rim: a perfect spin move and reverse layup. </p><p> "Damn!" Sadler whistled. </p><p> Two possessions later Brown waited under the basket for a rebound, using his larger body to block Garrett out, keeping Bill behind him and away from the basket. This time Garrett leaped from behind Brown, reached over him, and gracefully picked off the ball as it left the rim. </p><p> "Damn!" Sadler said a little louder. </p><p> Brown raised his eyebrows and said softly, "Guess we been away a while, Tom." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> By the time Loren Hemingway got to Shelbyville High School's Paul Cross Gym, the narrow basement dressing room assigned to freshmen was packed with ninth-grade boys horsing around, snapping jockstraps and towels. Hank, as friends had called him back in Franklin, didn't know any of them beyond a nod. A few months earlier his family had moved to Shelbyville from Franklin, a smaller town fourteen miles east. His father had taken a job managing Shelbyville's first supermarket, and even if the family could have afforded a car for the commute, wartime gasoline rationing would have made it impossible. Polite and shy, Hemingway had spent the summer exploring the new town with his younger brother, carrying his mother to Saint Joseph Catholic Church on the handlebars of the boys' shared bicycle, and waiting for basketball season. </p><p> Big-boned, still awkward, and barefoot, Hemingway edged around the clumps of boys in the dressing room and headed upstairs holding his worn sneakers in one hand. The shoes had been a parting gift from Tim Campbell, Franklin's head basketball coach. Twenty years earlier, when he had a swagger and a black mustache, Campbell had been Shelbyville's first real basketball coach, but now he was on the downside of his career. Campbell had found his rising ninth-grade basketball star sitting on the steps of Franklin's gym distraught over his family's impending move. For a long moment coach and young player had sat silently, until Campbell rose and slipped inside the gym without a word, returning with an old shoe box. Kneeling to face Hemingway, Campbell set the box beside him and said gently, "It'll be OK, son, once you get to Shelbyville and go out for basketball." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> After almost three hours of tryouts by sixty-plus boys, the gym was as humid as an Indiana July, and it smelled of fresh sweat. The playing floor was a few feet shy of the maximum regulation length, with a small dead spot under one basket where the ball refused to bounce, but in other ways it was one of the better gyms in the state, and to Hank Hemingway it looked bigger and the court more brightly polished than any he had seen before. The goals at each end had black rims and...</p></p><h2>Tally Cat Keeps Track (Math Is Fun!)</h2><p><p>Tally McNally is an alley cat who loves to tally!

Full of information about this ancient church, Mathewes-Greene--author of <i>Facing East</i> and a columnist for <i>Christianity Today</i>--uses a style that is both quirky and intellectual, moving easily from the conversational ("this wasn't one of those woo-woo spiritual experiences where everything goes misty") to references to great Orthodox theologians and rich, Annie Dillard-like prose. One example is her brief description of a young man she saw in California who believed he was Christ: "This is just someone's boy, someone's dreamer, who grabbed a sheet out of the linen closet and walked out of the suburbs, a nice young man breaking someone's heart, lost and gliding over the beautiful Santa Rosa Mountains in a private plane of bliss." While bearing the hallmarks of a fairly recent convert to the faith (some readers will have to adjust to her celebration of orthodoxy at the expense of both Catholicism and Protestantism), the book makes a fine introduction to orthodoxy for contemporary readers. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Frederica Mathewes-Green is a regular commentator for NPR&#39;s &#34;All Things Considered&#34; and a columnist for Christianity Today.

This is a universe you need to visit. If by some happy chance you don&#x2019;t already live there.</p> <p>The hero of this story, also named Charles Yu, ekes out a living there as a time travel repairman--"a certified network technician for T-class personal-use chronogramattical vehicles, and an approved independent affiliate contractor for Time Warner Time, which owns and operates this universe as a spatio-temporal structural and entertainment complex zoned for retail, commercial, and residential use." (Time Warner Time -- that's the kind of three-pointer Yu never misses.) Charles is a high-tech sad sack, whose only companions are a dog, who's mostly hypothetical, and a computer with a sexy feminine AI interface that Yu has a crush on.</p> <p>The thing about time travel in MU31 is that it's not all wormholes and apocalypses and "look out that's a temporal anomaly off the starboard nacelle, Captain!" Human beings mostly use time machines to go back and eavesdrop on their own screwed-up lives, reliving key moments, bad decisions and missed opportunities, in the mistaken belief that they can change them. They can't. "I have job security," Yu explains, "because what the customer wants, when you get right down to it, is to relive his very worst moment, over and over again."</p> <p>Not that Yu has it all figured out. His elderly mom is parked in a time loop, where she cooks a Sunday dinner over and over again. His father, a tragically frustrated inventor, is lost somewhere in the chronoverse. And Yu has a problem: one day he accidentally ran into his future self ... and shot him. That's right: he shot himself. And one day, the laws of the universe dictate, that future self will be him.</p> <p><em>How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</em> is a triumph, as good as anything in Calvino or Stanislaw Lem. I wish I could travel back in time with a copy and fraudulently publish it under my own name. Like most people, I thought I learned everything I needed to know about time travel from H.G. Wells and <em>Star Trek</em>, but I thought wrong: In Yu's skillful hands a worn-out science fiction plot device becomes a powerfully expressive metaphor for how we experience the flickering, ineffable, ungraspable spatio-temporal phenomenon of life. Because after all, we're all time travelers, blundering forward into the future at the rate of one second per subjectively experienced second.</p> <p>Except when we don't. Think about it: How many times have you yourself been trapped in a time loop, cycling obsessively through one inescapable moment, again and again and again, while the rest of the universe rolled forward and left you behind?</p> <strong>Questions for Charles Yu on <em>How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</em></strong> <p> </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You&#x2019;re a National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Award-winner and this is your debut novel. When and why did you start writing, and what advice do you have for other young writers out there trying to get published?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I wrote poems and essays as a kid, and in college, I dreamed of becoming a professional writer, whatever I thought that meant, although, for a lot of reasons, I knew that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen. Mostly, my parents were going to murder me if I tried to apply to an MFA program. First-degree murder.<br><br> So I didn&#x2019;t actually start writing until 2002, shortly after I began my career as a lawyer. Working in a high-pressure environment was squeezing me pretty hard, and all that pressure found its way out in the form of little things I was jotting down, in the margins of receipts, on the backs of business cards. I wrote a series of physics problems about a married couple&#x2019;s life together. I wrote some instructions for how to play a metaphysical video game. Stuff like that.<br> <br> But I didn&#x2019;t think I was actually writing, let alone writing what anyone would call fiction, until I read <em>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</em> by George Saunders. That book blew the doors off the empty little space that had previously housed my puny imagination. <br><br> Up until that point, I&#x2019;d had no clue as to what a story could be. And it was because my ideas were assumptions. Tacit, limiting, ultimately false assumptions, which added up to a severely impoverished conception of what was possible in fiction. After reading <em>CivilWarLand</em>, I knew I wanted that feeling, wanted to be surprised like that, and flattened onto the floor, and embarrassed my by own narrowness. I wanted to have my doors blown off again and again. It was a short distance to go from wanting to have that feeling to also wanting to see if maybe I could ever give that feeling to someone else.<br><br> As for advice, it would be to transfer all the anxiety about publication into anxiety about whether the story works, whether a reader is going to care about the characters. I break down the process into four components: writing, rewriting, submitting, and worrying. My ideal, not at all realistic, scenario, would be to make the proportion of time spent on each of those activities something like: 19 percent, 80 percent, 1 percent, 0 percent. This is very hypocritical of me to say, of course, as I&#x2019;ve never done this myself, I&#x2019;ve never even been close. But I do know that the farther from zero the last two numbers get, the more I&#x2019;m in trouble. And that the second number should be much bigger than the first.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How has your interest in and knowledge of science and science fiction contributed to and inspired your writing of this book?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I read and collected comics as a kid, read pretty much everything I could find of Asimov, including the whole <em>Foundation</em> series in one semester in eighth grade (to the detriment of my English grade), and so much else, too much to list or even remember. Then, at some point in high school, I got the idea that there were serious books we read in school, and there was science fiction, and there was not a lot of overlap. That lasted until my senior year in college, when I stumbled on Richard Powers&#x2019;s <em>Galatea 2.2</em>, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly science fiction, it was this amazing love story. It also handled actual science (cognitive science, artificial intelligence) without watering it down, and yet was still clearly Serious Fiction, whatever that meant to me back then, the kind that was in the Sunday book review sections. After that, I began to search out more writing like that, more Powers, and Jonathan Lethem.<br><br> Currently, I read more science than I do anything else, including fiction. I especially enjoy reading books written by scientists for lay folk, like me. I was a biochem major in college, and so part of it is that I am interested in the science itself, but I&#x2019;m just as interested in the process of explanation, how the author, an expert in a specialized field, tries to explain difficult concepts through simplification and creative analogy. I am fascinated by that process of distilling something really complex into something most people can understand. There are so many examples of great books that do this, but the one that still stands out for me is Brian Greene&#x2019;s <em>The Elegant Universe</em>. After finishing that book, I was convinced I had a working knowledge of string theory. I was like, I can do this stuff; I could hang with string theorists at a cocktail party. Of course, when I tried to explain even the simplest concept from the book to someone else, I realized how much Greene had been holding my hand. I was like a baby who thought he could walk, until I tried on my own.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Your book deals with time travel in a more serious and even tragic way than most stories about the subject, though you mask the severity with humor to keep the dialogue light and amusing. What made you decide to write about this complicated topic, and how did you come to write about it in this unique manner?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I knew I wanted the novel to be a family story, mostly about a father and son, but also about a marriage, and a son-mother story, too. But I could not find the right frame for the story. At the same time, I kept coming back to this idea that had been floating around in my head and on my laptop for years, but one that I could never find a home for. It was about of a man who keeps popping up in different hypothetical universes, trying to find the universe where he belongs. I&#x2019;d been messing around with that conceit, on and off, for close to five years. Then I remembered a book I&#x2019;d read years earlier, called <em>The Fabric of Reality</em>, by David Deutsch (which sets out, among other things, Deutsch&#x2019;s multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics), and in particular, one specific sentence from that book: &#x201c;Other times are just special cases of other universes.&#x201d; That sentence was a bridge for me. I realized I didn&#x2019;t want to write a story about hypothetical universes. I wanted to write a time travel story. <br><br> Once I decided that the novel would be about time travel, the book started to take shape. Not quickly, more like, I had a frame, and now little pieces started sticking to the frame, just odd scraps here and there, but the frame was the right one, and I could hang things on it. Most important, what happened was that the two vocabularies&#x2014;the emotion of a father-mother-son story and the technical glossary of a time travel story--started to interact; like two dry wool blankets, they started to rub up against each other and crackle a bit. Things would pop out of that, phraselets and new words and little surprises of grammar and language and emotion, and science fiction would fall out from that interaction. <br><br> Whatever humor there is in there, if any, is probably also a product of that process, of smashing together two sub-languages, emotional and science fictional, and seeing what weird tonal particles are produced from the collision. I knew that the story needed weight, because if it were just whimsical, a reader might wonder why any of it mattered, and of course, the most important thing that I am trying to do is create characters who matter to the reader. I do hope that there are at least a few laughs in there.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Your protagonist, a time travel technician attempting to save people from trying to alter their pasts, is named Charles Yu. How did you come to name him after yourself?<br> <strong>A:</strong> It was originally a placeholder, to be honest. So was the father&#x2019;s name, which is my father&#x2019;s name. I tried different names for the son and the father, but none of them would take, so I just put in my real name (and my dad&#x2019;s) so I could get going with the writing, but when I did that, a strange thing happened: the story started moving, fast, in a different direction. Suddenly, it was about a self meeting his self, and the details of the character&#x2019;s life started to come together, as did the relationship between the son and the father. I think having my actual name in there gave me a straw man, a straw story, that I could write in reaction to. For some reason, once the name of the character became Charles Yu, I stopped slipping in autobiographical or semi-autobiographical information, and actually started removing it. I think I realized, wow, if this character is going to have my name, I&#x2019;d better take some of this stuff out. There is still a fair amount of it in there, semi- or pseudo-autobiographical, but much of it is more emotionally resonant than factually resonant.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Though there is a definite science fictional aspect to your novel, it is also heavily literary and much more about real life than it at first appears. How, then, would you characterize your novel? Fiction, science fiction, or something outside the realm of typical genre classifications?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I was hoping it would be characterized as a time machine, although I realize there is no section for time machines in most bookstores. In terms of topology, I think of it as a stable, looped, four-dimensional object with chronodiegetic properties. In terms of genre, I would be happy for it to be shelved in both fiction and in science fiction. Or maybe under a new category, where they would put books that resist either classification. A lot of my favorite books would be in that category.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What&#x2019;s next for you?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I&#x2019;m working on a new novel that takes place in &#x201c;America,&#x201d; i.e., not America, but a dream-and-desire-fueled holographic projection of the collective mental environment of Americans, which exists as a geographical place that happens to overlap the physical America. It&#x2019;s also a story about a man looking for his ex-wife and daughter. I hope I can figure out a way to make that make sense.</p> (Photo � Michael Zara) <br>Charles Yu was born in Los Angeles.

Peggy Klaus, a Fortune 500 communication coach, sharpened her strategies in Hollywood, "the bragging capitol of the world," where she learned the art of tooting your horn, without blowing it. "To brag is to talk about your best self with pride and passion in a conversational manner." explains Klaus. She includes a snappy "Bragging Dictionary" with highly practical techniques including instructions for the "Bragalogue," a brief memorable elevator pitch and a "Brag bag," the collection of your greatest hits with colorful details that can be easily accessed. <p> Bragging rights and responsibilities are surveyed in a variety of situations: the co-worker who takes credit, techno-bragging online, performance reviews, job interviews and working a room. Klaus peppers her points with examples from her coaching sessions and seminars, sample dialogues and self-assessments. Although several examples may seem too studied, Klaus has much to brag about. This is a book that will change the way you think about the slippery skill of selling yourself. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><i></i></p>Peggy Klaus, a skilled lecturer, lives in Berkeley, California.</p><h2>Avery Harris Civil War Journal</h2><p>The Avery Harris Civil War Journal chronicles the memoirs of Avery Harris of Benton Twp., Pennsylvania and his experiences during the Civil War. Mr. Harris was 22 years of age when he enlisted in August 1862 to join the new recruits of the Pa. 143'rd regiment at Camp Luzerne in the Wyoming Valley of N.E. Pennsylvania. His recollections include the folksy accounts of the many hardships of camp life, the battles of Gettysburg, Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Weldon Railroad, and Hatchers Run among other more minor skirmishes. His story also tells about his mustering out of service in June 1865 and his reception upon returning home. <p> The book is an interesting account of the Civil War as seen from the experiences of one who suffered through it. At times the story is amusing as it is sad and filled with many personal anecdotes that take the reader back in time to this important era that had a major influence on the shaping of our great country.</p></p><p></p><h2>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</h2><p>&#34;A plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street grows into a story that no one can beat!&#34; In this delightful tale, Young Marco allows his imagination to run riot as he travels home from school one day, to the extent that a horse and cart is soon transformed into a chaotic carnival of colourful creatures. This delightful book forms part of the second stage in HarperCollins&#39; major Dr. Seuss rebrand programme. With the relaunch of 10 more titles in August 2003, such all-time favourites as How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? and Dr. Seuss&#39; Sleep Book boast bright new covers that incorporate much needed guidance on reading levels: Blue Back Books are for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books are for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books are for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street belongs to the Green Back Book range.</p><p>Marco is in a pickle. His father has instructed him to keep his eyes peeled for interesting sights on the way to and from school, but all Marco has seen is a boring old horse and wagon. Imagine if he had something more to report, say, a zebra pulling the wagon. Or better yet, the zebra could be pulling a blue and gold chariot. No, wait! Maybe it should be a reindeer in that harness. Marco's story grows ever more elaborate as he reasons that a reindeer would be happier pulling a sled, then that a <i>really</i> unusual sight would be an elephant with a ruby-bedecked rajah enthroned on top. "Say! That makes a story that <i>no one</i> can beat, / When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street." Time and again, Marco tops himself until he is positively wound up with excitement and bursts into his home to tell his dad what he saw on Mulberry Street.<p> Pulitzer-prize winning Dr. Seuss needs no introduction. His ode to the imagination of a child is as fresh and exquisitely outlandish today as it was when first published in 1937. This is a classic that will never fade with age.

As little Marco describes the horse and wagon he saw on Mulberry Street, they are transformed into an elephant and a band wagon with a retinue of police.</p><h2>The Unlevel Playing Field: A Documentary History of the African American Experience in Sport (Sport and Society)</h2><p>A comprehensive study of black participation in sports since slavery reveals a checkered history of prejudice and cultural bias that have plagued American sports from the beginning.</p><p>David K. Wiggins is the coeditor of "Rivals: Legendary Matchups That Made Sports History" and "Out of the Shadows: A Biographical History of African American Athletes".<br><br>Patrick B. Miller is Professor of History at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.The African American sports experience in America has been the subject of dozens of books that range from serious historical analyses to as-told-to autobiographies of star performers. The authors of this volume, both university history professors, do readers a great service by emphasizing the importance of original source material rather than their own interpretations of it. They provide a context for each selection and offer some opinion--why the piece is significant--but generally the reader is given the opportunity to form his or her own thoughts. The selections are presented more or less chronologically, which helps give the reader a sense of the journey African Americans have made in the sports world. Among the highlights are essays on Tom Molineaux, a boxer who competed in the early 1800s and is regarded as the first black sporting hero. There is an article by W. E. B. Du Bois, written in 1897, in which the great civil rights leader argues that sports can offer black Americans an avenue for amusement and recreation. Eldridge Cleaver weighs in on the Muhammad Ali-Floyd Patterson fights of the mid-sixties, and a transcript of Ali on television's <i>Face the Nation</i> is included from 1976, displaying again his remarkable media savvy and wit. Also included are articles on Arthur Ashe, racism in the NFL, and the current marketing of black athletes. A fascinating cultural document and a great addition to any general collection. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Written by the acclaimed author of <i>High Tide,</i> this highly relevant and compelling book uses accessible journalistic prose to distill what environmental scientists portend about the consequences of human pollution for the next hundred years. <br><br>In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report projecting average global surface temperatures to rise between 1.4 degrees and 5.8 degrees Celsius (roughly 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century. Based on this forecast, author Mark Lynas outlines what to expect from a warming world, degree by degree. At 1 degree Celsius, most coral reefs and many mountain glaciers will be lost. A 3-degree rise would spell the collapse of the Amazon rainforest, disappearance of Greenland's ice sheet, and the creation of deserts across the Midwestern United States and southern Africa. A 6-degree increase would eliminate most life on Earth, including much of humanity. <br><br>Based on authoritative scientific articles, the latest computer models, and information about past warm events in Earth history, <i>Six Degrees</i> promises to be an eye-opening warning that humanity will ignore at its peril.</p><p>Mark Lynas, a journalist, campaigner, and broadcast commentator on environmental issues, is the author of <i>High Tide: News from a Warming World.</i> He is a contributor to periodicals including <i>New Statesman, Ecologist, Granta,</i> and <i>Geographical,</i> and to the <i>Guardian</i> and <i>Observer</i> newspapers in the United Kingdom.Adult/High School&#x2014;Lynas has gathered global-warming information from an array of authoritative scientists: geologists, glaciologists, oceanographers, climate scientists, and paleoclimatologists, as well as "major scientific projections" from computer modelers. He divides his findings into six main chapters representing the consequences of a one- to six-degree shift in temperature rise. More factual than hysterical and using accessible language, the author portrays a sobering, but broad and fascinating, view of the problem. He discusses not only the environmental consequences of melting icecaps, ocean warming, coral reef bleaching, CO2 emissions, deforestation, and severe weather, but also cultural and economic reverberations-the result of population shifts, animal migrations, and societal collapse. Through computer-modeling simulations he looks back into the past (the Pliocene, the Mayan civilization) and projects into the future for CO2 comparisons. His premise: the problem is now at global scale and will not just impact the disappearance of one group alone as it did the Maya. Claiming that solutions must be political, and that it is too late for quick fixes using renewable energy sources or technology, he concludes with some cautionary possible solutions: relocalization of goods and services, less consumption, global-scale carbon rationing, and a "2 degree increase target." Anyone studying climate change will find this a helpful reference as much current research has been precompiled and interpreted within one resource.&#x2014;<i>Jodi Mitchell, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has won the World Fantasy Award for Koko (1989), and the Bram Stoker Award for his novels The Throat (1993), Mr. X.(1999) and Lost Boy, Lost Girl (2003) as well as for his collection of short stories, 5 Stories (2007). He lives in New York City.This collection of 13 psychic and horror fictions--seven of them short-shorts--reveals Straub at his spellbinding best. Two tales (first installments of his Blue Rose trilogy), are linked to Koko and Mystery and exactingly probe the consequences of boyhood clashes with evil. In "Blue Rose," sadistic Harry Beevers, 10, hypnotizes and destroys his younger brother; the tale leaps ahead to the ironic verdict in Harry's court-martial for wreaking atrocities in Vietnam. In the outstanding "The Juniper Tree," a novelist relives a harrowing, seductive summer when, at age seven, he was sexually molested in a movie house by drifter Stan, a seedy Alan Ladd lookalike. "The Buffalo Hunter" fastidiously chronicles the fixations of a 35-year-old who numbs his fear of women by sucking his coffee and cognac from baby bottles. In the ambitious gothic thriller/academic spoof "Mrs. God," a fatuous professor is lured to a creepy English mansion crammed with grisly secrets to research the papers of his poet ancestress; dead babies provide a subtheme. Wry and riveting, "A Short Guide to the City" fuses and parodies two genres: the self-congratulatory tourist blurb with a news alert on the "viaduct killer." In addition to having popular allure, Straub's fictions are playfully postmodern, resonating with insights on genre, craft and process. 150,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Practice of Management</h2><p><p> A classic since its publication in 1954, <i>The Practice of Management</i> was the first book to look at management as a whole and being a manager as a separate responsibility. <i>The Practice of Management</i> created the discipline of modern management practices.

But humans are more than computers, and the cutting-edge research in cognitive science is increasingly focused on the more mysterious, creative aspects of the mind. The Way We Think is a landmark synthesis that exemplifies this new direction. The theory of conceptual blending is already widely known in laboratories throughout the world; this book is its definitive statement. Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner argue that all learning and all thinking consist of blends of metaphors based on simple bodily experiences. These blends are then themselves blended together into an increasingly rich structure that makes up our mental functioning in modern society. A child&#39;s entire development consists of learning and navigating these blends. The Way We Think shows how this blending operates; how it is affected by (and gives rise to) language, identity, and concept of category; and the rules by which we use blends to understand ideas that are new to us. The result is a bold, exciting, and accessible new view of how the mind works.</p><p><b>Gilles Fauconnier</b> is Research Professor in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. <b>Mark Turner</b> is Institute Professor and Professor of Cognitive Science at Case Western Reserve University.&nbsp;Conceptual blending, a process that operates below the level of consciousness and involves connecting two concepts to create new meaning, can be used to explain abstract thought, creativity, and language. It is, according to the authors, "at the heart of imagination." This theory, an outcome of a 1992 project led by Fauconnier (chair, cognitive science, Univ. of California, San Diego) and Turner (chair, English, Univ. of Maryland), describes a basic mental operation that is unique to the human species. Numerous examples are offered to illustrate conceptual blending and to demonstrate how it may play out in different "conceptual niches." Blends, which occur constantly without our awareness, are critical for the creation of emergent meanings and "global insight." The authors further argue that language surfaced naturally once the capacity for blending had developed to a critical level about 50,000 years ago. This theory requires a language of its own, generating such terms as counterfactual thinking, compression, projection, and vital relations. While skillfully written, the text, like the human mind, is rather complex. Recommended for cognitive science collections in academic libraries.
